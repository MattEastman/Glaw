				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To be arrested for a crime can be a very overwhelming situation. It often times leaves individuals confused, especially if they know that they are innocent. Chicago has been in the news over the years for allegations of police abuse of power. To add to the fire are startling facts that reveal that less than 0.5% of individuals who are arrested actually get to see an attorney following their arrest.</p>
<p>This information was revealed by CNN following a request from the Chicago Police Department. It is on the heels of a report from a task force established by the Chicago Mayor to investigate the police practices. The results of that report indicated that persons arrested were only able to make phone calls after processing and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Is This a Breach of Constitutional Rights?</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/criminal-defense/">right to an attorney</a> is a right afforded to all individuals who are charged. It is a constitutional right that is an integral part of the Miranda Rights that is repeated to persons who are being arrested. In response to the statistics, the Chicago police department maintains that each detainee is read his or her rights and that many are released after processing without any questioning.</p>
<p>The task force report and the CNN story is cause for much concern, especially in a city where murder rates are high and there are ever growing outraged about racial profiling and brutality by the police force. The Chicago Police department states that there were no breaches of constitutional rights and that many persons opt not to call a lawyer so as not to prolong their processing. But with more than 99% of arrestees not having access to even free legal aid, the Chicago Police is coming under more fire.</p>
<h3>What Should You Do if You&#8217;re Arrested</h3>
<p>Knowing your rights is critical to every criminal case. Being able to stand firm in those rights can make a significant difference. Here are some useful tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not resist arrest</strong> – This is can lead to further charges and may aggravate an otherwise calm situation. If you feel that you are being arrested as a result of racial profiling or without probable cause, verbally express your concerns, but do not seek to assault the police officer. Remember if the police officer is going to arrest you, he or she will proceed, so physical resistance will not help.</li>
<li><strong>Remain silent</strong> – Once arrested whatever you say can be used against you. It is, therefore, important that you only provide information that is necessary to your processing. You should decline to answer questions by remaining silent or asking for an attorney.</li>
<li><strong>Ask for an attorney</strong> – You have a right to an attorney and you should indicate that at the earliest possible opportunity. Many innocent individuals get into further trouble by answering what seem like innocent questions without a Chicago criminal defense attorney present.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always remember that the police have a job to do and their objective is generally different from yours. You should always secure your rights by making sure you have a lawyer present after your arrest. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chicago authorities are facing unprecedented scrutiny over their inability to maintain an effective and equitable criminal justice system. Amidst allegations that mayor Rahm Emanuel knew of—and covered up—a video of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Laquan_McDonald" target="_blank">police killing teenager Laquan MacDonald</a>, the Department of Justice has announced that it will conduct an in-depth investigation of the Chicago Police Department. </p>
<p>The Chicago Police Department has been unable to stem an epidemic of <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/firearms/">gun violence</a>, with 150 shootings occurring within the city during the first two weeks of 2016 alone, resulting in over twenty deaths. Even more worrying is the fact that the Chicago Police Department is a significant source of gun violence itself, and that civilian complaints over police misconduct rarely result in disciplinary action.</p>
<h3>The Chicago Police Department’s Wanton Use of Force Is Inexcusable</h3>
<p>On December 25, 2015, the police responded to a domestic dispute by fatally shooting teenager Quintonio LeGrier and an elderly bystander. LeGrier was armed with a baseball bat, so he could have been subdued through the use of non-lethal force, such as a Taser. Also troubling is a shocking new video showing the death of an unarmed teenager, Cedrick Chatman, at the hands of the Chicago Police Department in January 2013. </p>
<p>On January 7, 2013, Chatman ran from a stolen vehicle he was driving, with two police officers in hot pursuit. Seven seconds after he exited the vehicle he was dead. Officer Kevin Fry shot Chatman four times because he believed the teenager had a gun, and that he had “turned slightly” towards his partner. In fact, Chatham was carrying an iPhone box, and at no time took a menacing stance towards the officers or any bystanders. </p>
<p>In America, the police can only use deadly force against a suspect if they have good reason to believe that they or any bystanders are facing an immediate threat of serious bodily harm. Needless to say, these conditions did not exist at the time of Chatman’s shooting, just like in the cases of Laquan McDonald and Quintonio LeGrier. Instead, it seems that these boys were gunned down because of the color of their skin.</p>
<h3>The Independent Police Review Authority Is Flawed</h3>
<p>The Chatman shooting was quietly investigated by the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA). The investigator working on the case, Lorenzo Davis, found the shooting unjustified but his superiors disagreed and overruled his findings. After the IPRA cleared Fry of any wrongdoing, they fired Investigator Davis, who is now suing the city of Chicago for wrongful termination. </p>
<p>The IPRA offers civilians a means of voicing their complaints against the police. But records show that the IPRA has historically failed in its mission. For example, over 2,000 Chicago police officers have at least one complaint of excessive force against them. But only around 150 of these complaints have resulted in disciplinary action, and in most cases disciplinary action involved suspension for a week or less—a small price to pay for violating the rights of the very citizens the police are supposed to protect. </p>
<p>Officer Fry, who killed Cedrick Chatman, had 30 complaints lodged against him during his twelve-year tenure, ten of which were for excessive use of force. But he was never punished. As for Officer Van Dyke, who killed Laquan McDonald, he had three allegations of excessive force and one for issuing racial slurs, but he was never disciplined and was able to remain on the streets, with tragic consequences.</p>
<h3>The Rights and Safety of Chicago’s Citizens Are at Stake</h3>
<p>In the aftermath of the McDonald case, Mayor Emanuel ordered the replacement of the IRSA’s boss. But in the absence of a systematic overview of the IPRA’s oversight procedures, Emanuel’s move appears to be largely symbolic. The Chicago government needs to take concrete steps towards improving the disciplinary measures available against cops who exhibit violent or racist behavior. </p>
<p>With the Department of Justice beginning an exhaustive review of the Chicago Police Department, there is some hope that reform may be on the way. Until then, criminal suspects will need to rely on passionate and effective legal representation if they want to stand a fair chance when facing the criminal justice system. That’s when Chicago criminal defense attorney <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/michael-omeara/">Michael O&#8217;Meara</a> of O’Meara Law LLC comes in.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Attorney General Loretta Lynn announced on December 7th that the Justice Department will be conducting a civil rights investigation into the use of deadly force by Chicago cops. </p>
<p>In light of the recent shooting of teenager Laquan McDonald by Chicago policeman Jason Van Dyke, many see the investigation as a necessary step in holding the authorities fully responsible for the tragedy. But some—including two Chicago aldermen—think the investigation should also look into City Hall and the conduct of Mayor Rahm Emanuel and his administration. </p>
<p>Indeed, it was only until a Chicago judge ordered Mayor Emanuel to release a video of the shooting that the prosecutor’s office decided to charge the responsible officer. Other videos of the incident have mysteriously disappeared, which seems to point to a cover-up attempt—possibly orchestrated within the highest levels of Chicago’s government.</p>
<h3>Recent Shootings Highlight Problems Within the CPD</h3>
<p>The police had good reason to apprehend Mr. McDonald—he was seen trying to break into vehicles. It later emerged that he had PCP in his system, which probably contributed to his erratic behavior. But nothing he did even came close to justifying the police’s use of deadly force against him.</p>
<p>The police are only allowed to use deadly force against a suspect when the suspect is putting the police or others at risk of death or serious injury. Jason Van Dyke reported that he shot Mr. McDonald because he moved threateningly towards the officers—five of whom corroborated Officer Van Dyke’s version of events.</p>
<p>But the video of Mr. McDonald’s shooting clearly shows that he did not pose an immediate threat to the officers or any bystanders. This means that the Chicago police are willing to lie to protect themselves from the consequences of their actions. In how many other, unreported cases has this occurred?</p>
<h3>The Justice Department Will Conduct a Systematic Investigation of the CPD</h3>
<p>While the recent shooting of Laquan McDonald clearly prompted the Justice Department to take action, their investigation will probe deeper than this recent shooting. They will conduct a systematic overview of every aspect of the Chicago Police Department.</p>
<p>In the wake of the McDonald shooting, Mayor Emanuel initially defended the police department and its superintendent, but once the video of the shooting became public, Emanuel backtracked. He fired the superintendent and acknowledged that the Chicago Police Department has a long history of excessive force, poor oversight, and lack of discipline.</p>
<p>The Independent Police Review Authority, or IPRA, a civilian agency tasked with the investigation of excessive force allegations against the police, has not been providing the oversight needed. Since its creation in 2007, the IPRA has only found that two out of more than 400 claims against the police were credible. The IPRA’s director, Scott Ando, has just resigned.</p>
<h3>Chicago Has A Long History of Police Brutality</h3>
<p>This spring, the Chicago city council voted to create a fund of over $5 million to compensate the victims of the police department’s use of torture under Jon Burge in the 1970s and 1980s.  </p>
<p>Burge and his accomplices tortured hundreds of mostly African-American suspects, subjecting them to electric shocks, burns, and mock executions in order to extract confessions. Burge served four and a half years in prison before being released last year. He now receives a police pension. </p>
<p>Over the last forty years, the Chicago Police Department has built a legacy for violence and lack of accountability, and it is likely that more dark chapters of its history will come to light as the Justice Department’s investigation proceeds.</p>
