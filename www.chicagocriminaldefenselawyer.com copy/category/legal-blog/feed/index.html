				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On July 29, 2016, Illinois became the 17th state in the nation to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana. Senate Bill 2228, which went into effect immediately, makes it a civil offense—like a traffic ticket—to possess any amount of marijuana under 10 grams. There is no possibility of jail time for this offense, and the fines range from $100 to $200.</p>
<h3>Illinois Lawmakers Reform the State’s Approach to Marijuana Policy</h3>
<p>The new law comes after several Illinois cities and municipalities decriminalized marijuana, starting with Chicago in 2012. <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/billstatus.asp?DocNum=2228&#038;GAID=13&#038;GA=99&#038;DocTypeID=SB&#038;LegID=93232&#038;SessionID=88" target="_blank">Senate Bill 2228</a> will not override older municipal ordinances that decriminalize marijuana, so the fines for possessing marijuana may be different in different parts of the state. </p>
<p>Senate Bill 2228 does more than decriminalize marijuana—it puts in place several reforms that will lessen the burdens on the state’s marijuana users. For one, a conviction for the civil offense of marijuana possession automatically gets expunged after 6 months. This means that the drug offense will be invisible to potential employers who perform background checks.</p>
<p>These reforms aren’t just good for marijuana users—they’re good for the finances of the state of Illinois. According to an Illinois Sentencing Policy Advisory Council financial impact analysis, Senate Bill 2228 will save the state an estimated $24 million over three years from the reduced cost of incarcerating marijuana offenders and the increased revenue from the fines.</p>
<p>The new policy is in line with Governor Rauner’s plan to reduce Illinois’s prison population by a quarter over the next ten years. Under the old legal framework, the possession of 10 grams of marijuana was punishable by up to 6 months in jail. That meant that the state would have to spend money on housing and feeding marijuana offenders in detention instead of just collecting a fine. </p>
<h3>Illinois is No Longer a Zero Tolerance State for DUI Cases Involving Marijuana</h3>
<p>The new law also changes the state’s approach to <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/dui/driving-under-influence-of-drugs/" title="Driving Under the Influence of Drugs">DUI cases involving marijuana impairment</a>. Previously a “zero tolerance” state on weed and driving, Illinois will now allow people to drive a vehicle so long as their blood concentration of THC does not exceed 5 nanograms. Illinois drivers no longer need to fear a DUI charge for smoking a joint a week before getting pulled over. </p>
<p>There is no scientific consensus on what blood concentration of THC correlates with impairment, so the new THC limit is arbitrary. Nonetheless, the small margin of safety is welcome news to marijuana users—especially medical marijuana patients who may need to medicate daily to treat their illness. </p>
<p>While Senate Bill 2228 is a step in one direction, marijuana users in Illinois may still face criminal charges. When a blood test show’s that a driver’s THC level is over the limit, he or she will face <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/dui/" title="Chicago DUI Lawyer">DUI charges</a>. Individuals who get caught with less than 10 grams of marijuana along with a scale or baggies may still get charged with drug dealing.</p>
<p>In such cases, you can count on the dedication of O’Meara Law LLC. Our goal is to give each and every one of our clients the best prospects possible as they face the Illinois criminal justice system.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you got pulled over and charged with a <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/drug-crimes/"title="Drug Crimes">drug crime</a> in LaSalle or Madison Counties, an upcoming Illinois Supreme Court decision may affect your case. The issue at hand is whether LaSalle County state attorney Brian Towne overstepped his authority when he conceived the State Attorney Felony Enforcement (SAFE) team in 2011, which employed former police officers to conduct patrols, perform traffic stops, and seize the property of suspected traffickers. Madison County implemented a similar program in 2014.</p>
<h3>SAFE Teams Have Confiscated Millions on Illinois Highways</h3>
<p>Ostensibly, the goal of the SAFE units is to aid in the prosecution of <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/drug-crimes/drug-trafficking/"title="Drug Trafficking">drug traffickers</a>. In this respect, they have been very successful, having contributed towards the conviction of 66 individuals. But critics claim that these teams also profited from their law enforcement activities. In 2014 alone, the LaSalle County SAFE team confiscated $900,000 in cash, 14 vehicles, tens of thousands of dollars in gold and silver, and $7.9 million worth of drugs such as marijuana, methamphetamine, and cocaine. </p>
<p>Under the laws of civil asset forfeiture, law enforcement agencies can keep the cash and other valuables that they confiscate from drug crime suspects. They don’t have to return the property even if the suspects prove their innocence in court. Instead, the suspects must challenge the seizure through a different court hearing. Out of 50 seizures that occurred in LaSalle County, less than half resulted in criminal charges, and an even smaller portion resulted in actual convictions. </p>
<p>The SAFE teams had bank accounts to hold the cash obtained from property seizures, and they would share their loot with local police agencies that offered the use of their K9 units. With most of the confiscations not resulting in any criminal charges, it seems that the SAFE units’ practical purpose was not to aid in the prosecution of criminals, but to fill the coffers of the state attorney’s office at the expense of people who were never proven guilty in court. </p>
<h3>Did SAFE Teams Have Authority to Arrest and Seize Assets?</h3>
<p>The state attorney offices of both LaSalle and Madison County claim that the SAFE teams helped keep drugs off the streets. Even if many of the confiscations didn’t result in criminal charges, they argue, the seized money was used to strengthen the state attorney offices’ ability to effectively prosecute other suspects. Whatever the beneficial effect of these seizures, these arguments gloss over important issues.</p>
<p>The appeals court—which took the side of the suspects whose property was seized—stated: &#8220;The prosecution of drug dealers and traffickers is indisputably a duty of the State&#8217;s Attorney; outfitting his own drug interdiction unit is not. Such a statutory construction would effectively give the State&#8217;s Attorney the power to create and maintain the equivalent of his own police force.&#8221; In other words, some judicial authorities have taken the view that the SAFE teams are not legitimate law enforcement agencies. </p>
<p>Further, the Illinois Cannabis Control Act and the Drug Asset Forfeiture Procedure Act both include a section that states: &#8220;While forfeiture may secure for state and local units of government some resources for deterring drug abuse and drug trafficking, forfeiture is not intended to be an alternative means of funding the administration of criminal justice.&#8221; This provision stands in direct contradiction with the activities and structure of the SAFE teams. </p>
<p>Until the Illinois Supreme Court makes a final decision on the legality of the SAFE teams, their activities have been suspended. This means that only members of traditional law enforcement agencies will be making traffic stops on the highways of Illinois, and the prosecutor’s offices won’t be taking money from the very people they are putting behind bars. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>State legislation signed into law this month will loosen restrictions on what parolees can do after their release. Previously, people released from prison on parole were not allowed to attend events where other ex-offenders might be present. Unfortunately, this meant that many ex-offenders were unable to attend worship gatherings, community service events, and volunteer programs because of the likelihood of running into another ex-offender. </p>
<p>This restriction aimed to reduce recidivism by preventing ex-offenders from being exposed to their former criminal associates or gangs. But in practice, the restrictions isolated parolees at a time when they needed to connect with their community. The new law aims to balance the need to protect parolees from their former criminal lives while giving them meaningful opportunities to engage with their community and peers. </p>
<h3>When Can Ex-offenders on Parole Meet with One Another?</h3>
<p>Penned by State Senator Jacqueline Y. Collins (D-Chicago 16th), this criminal justice reform will allow ex-offenders to congregate under certain circumstances without facing the risk of a parole violation. According to Collins: “Freedom of association in positive settings can facilitate a smooth reentry into society and help those on parole obtain the help and resources they need to succeed outside the prison walls.” </p>
<p>According to Illinois law (730 ILCS 5/3-3-7), every person released on parole must refrain from knowingly associating with other people on parole, individuals on supervised release, or gang members, except:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the parole agent has given his or her written permission</li>
<li>For a community event</li>
<li>For a worship service</li>
<li>A mentoring or volunteer program</ul>
</li>
<p>Making these exceptions is important, according to Senator Collins, because: “Participation — alongside others with similar life stories — in a religious congregation, community service organization or mentoring program can serve as a powerful catalyst for purpose and change, and as we continue to struggle as a society with cycles of recidivism and violent crime, we must embrace creative solutions.” </p>
<h3>What Happens If I Violate My Parole Conditions?</h3>
<p>When you’re released on parole, your freedom depends on whether you obey your parole conditions. These conditions may include the obligation to maintain a job, to continue with school, to notify the parole agent of any change of address, to submit to drug tests, to refrain from owning firearms, and of course not to associate with criminals. A violation of these conditions may result in both administrative and criminal sanctions.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the parole board cannot simply send you back to prison. They must first give you a hearing, where you may benefit from the assistance of a Chicago criminal defense attorney. During the hearing, the parole board must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that you actually violated your parole conditions—only then may you face penalties. A skilled legal advocate by your side can ensure that you maintain your dignity and freedom in the face of parole violation accusations.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The State of Illinois takes a tough stance on drinking and driving, and with good reason. In 2014, 281 people in Illinois lost their lives in crashes that occurred because someone was drinking and driving. Around 30% of all fatal crashes involve alcohol, so the authorities view the fight against drunk driving as a priority.</p>
<p>To make the roads safer, the Illinois legislature has gone a step farther than outlawing driving under the influence (DUI). It is also illegal to have an open alcohol container anywhere in the vehicle’s driver or passenger area—regardless of whether the driver or any passengers are actually intoxicated.</p>
<p>While not as serious as a <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/dui/dui-conviction-effects/" title="DUI Conviction">DUI conviction</a>, driving with an open container will seriously affect your finances and driving record. With 3,569 convictions in 2014 alone, illegal transportation of alcohol is a common offense in Illinois. Many of the accused simply plead guilty to the charges without a fight. But by hiring an experienced Chicago criminal defense attorney, you may be able to avoid the penalties for driving with an open container.</p>
<h3>What Are the Penalties for Driving with an Open Container?</h3>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=062500050K11-502" title="Transportation or possession of alcoholic liquor in a motor vehicle" target="_blank">section 11-502 of the Illinois Vehicle Code</a>, it is illegal for someone to transport, carry, possess or have an open alcohol container in the passenger area of a vehicle on any highway in Illinois. The alcoholic beverage container is considered to be open whenever the seal is broken. If you have an unsealed water bottle or other container containing any amount of alcohol, you may be charged—even if you haven’t had a sip. </p>
<p>The only exception to the rule against open containers involves limousines, chartered buses, and motor homes, where it is legal for open containers to be present in the separate passenger area of the vehicle. Of course, it is still illegal for the driver to have access to an open container. </p>
<p>Driving with an open container is charged as a petty offense—the least serious category of criminal offenses. Nonetheless, the penalties may be harsh. If convicted, you may face up to $1,000 in fines and possible jail time in egregious cases. In addition, you will face a suspended license—unless it’s you second conviction within a single year, in which case your license will get revoked. </p>
<h3>How Can an Illinois Criminal Defense Lawyer Help?</h3>
<p>To convict you of illegally transporting alcohol, the state prosecutor will need to present evidence that proves beyond a reasonable doubt that you had an open container in your vehicle’s passenger area. The evidence will likely be the arresting officer’s observations during the traffic stop and any open containers visible in plain sight or found during a search of your vehicle. </p>
<p>Your lawyer can ask the judge to remove this evidence from the prosecutor’s case when:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The police stopped you without probable cause</strong> — The police can’t just pull you over on the hunch that they will catch you doing something wrong. The police can only stop your car if they have a warrant or if there is a reason to believe that you are doing something illegal. Any evidence from an illegal traffic stop must be removed from the prosecutor’s case.</li>
<li><strong>The arresting officer performed an unreasonable vehicle search</strong> — If the police see an open container in plain sight, such as on your seat, the prosecutor can use that evidence. But only under some circumstances are the police allowed to search your vehicle for contraband. If the police didn’t have your consent or probable cause to search your vehicle, the evidence obtained from that search must be excluded from the case.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People shy away from hiring attorneys for many reasons. Sometimes people worry about the expense while others fear an attorney might escalate the situation, making it more contentious than it needs to be. More than a few people feel they can handle the situation themselves. The problem with all of these reasons and others is that they are often unfounded fears and they fail to take into the consideration the extreme consequences of not hiring a criminal defense attorney. There are many benefits of working with an attorney, culminating in the fact that a lawyer is better equipped to keep you out of jail. If you are facing criminal charges, call Chicago criminal defense lawyer <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/michael-omeara/"title="Learn More About Michael O'Meara">Michael O’Meara</a> for help as soon as possible. </p>
<h3>Top 5 Reasons to Hire a Criminal Defense Lawyer</h3>
<p>There are more reasons to <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/criminal-defense/"title="Chicago Criminal Defense">hire a defense attorney</a> than we can list, but here are the Top 5 reasons for having a lawyer by your side:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Legal Knowledge and experience</strong>:
<p>Individuals without any legal training or experience can go through the criminal court process alone, but they will be trying to figure out what to do every step of the way. Prosecutors will always be steps ahead and have the advantage. Instead of trying to learn what you should or need to do while facing a criminal offense, get help from someone who has years of legal training and experience.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Analysis of your case</strong>:
<p> Your attorney will speak with you, review the prosecutor’s evidence, and investigate your situation in order to thoroughly analyze your case compared to the law. An experienced criminal defense attorney can give you an honest review of your situation, including your worst and best case scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Seek to have your case dismissed or charges reduced</strong>:
<p> A criminal defense attorney will always look to see if there is any legal basis for having your case dismissed entirely or the charges reduced. You may think there is a strong case against you and your situation is hopeless. A defense attorney will be able to see if that’s true or not.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Have certain evidence excluded or included</strong>:
<p> In some cases, prosecutors will have evidence that should be excluded from the case for various reasons. It may have been obtained illegally or by hearsay. A lawyer will motion to have this type of evidence excluded so that it can’t hurt you in court. On the other hand, you lawyer will also work to have evidence that supports your case.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Fight for reduced penalties</strong>:
<p>Whether it is through a negotiated plea bargain or during sentencing after a guilty verdict, an experienced criminal defense attorney understands how to argue to the minimum consequences of a conviction. This may include seeking little to no jail through the use of probation or community service.</p>
</ol>
</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you know your rights if you are pulled over by the police? If you do, you’re one of a few. Many people aren’t sure of how they should behave when the police pull them over. What instructions are they required to follow and what requests can they deny? This lack of certainty leads many people to not uphold their constitutional rights, which can be detrimental to them in a future court case for a traffic or criminal offense. That is why Illinois will now require driver’s education classes to address a person’s rights during Illinois traffic stops. But if you did not receive this type of education in school or from family, you may have been in a <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/traffic-violations/"title="Traffic Violations">traffic stop</a> without understanding what you could and could not do or say.</p>
<p>If you are facing the consequences of a traffic stop, call the experienced Chicago criminal defense attorneys at <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/"title="Chicago Criminal Defense Lawyer">O’Meara Law</a> at <strong><span class="ibp"> </span></strong>.</p>
<h3>New Driver’s Education Training Coming Soon</h3>
<p>Gov. Bruce Rauner signed bill HB6131 into law in the beginning of August. The new curriculum requirement goes into effect during the 2017-18 school year or after June 30, 2017, for private driving schools. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocTypeID=HB&#038;DocNum=6131&#038;GAID=13&#038;SessionID=88&#038;LegID=95665" target="_blank">synopsis of the bill</a> states that driving course should include instruction on law enforcement procedures during traffic stops, “including a demonstration of the proper actions to be taken during a traffic stop and appropriate interactions with law enforcement.” The Illinois Secretary of State will develop the guidelines for this requirement.  </p>
<p>Many believe this law is timely because of news coverage revolving around traffic stops that have escalated leading to a drivers&#8217; injury or death. Legislators believe that if a driver understands how to behave when stopped by the police, there will be no need for the situation to turn dangerous or deadly for anyone. </p>
<h3>Your Rights During A Traffic Stop</h3>
<p>People who are unaware of their rights at a traffic stop can escalate a simple situation into an argument with the police. Here are some of your key rights when you are involved in a traffic stop:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You must identify yourself</strong>: The police will first ask for your license and probably your car insurance. You need to give them your name, license, and insurance card.</li>
<li><strong>You do not have to answer other questions</strong>: The police generally ask you a few questions like where you are coming from or going to, or do you know how fast you were driving. You don’t have to answer. It may be best to calmly state that you will not answer any questions without an attorney present.</li>
<li><strong>You must get out of the car</strong>: If the police suspect you of <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/dui/"title="Chicago DUI Lawyer">drinking and driving</a> or another crime, they may ask you to get out of the car. You are legally required to comply. Follow the police officer’s instructions calmly. </li>
<li><strong>You do not have to take a field sobriety test</strong>: Field sobriety tests are not mandatory and you can calmly tell the police officer that you will not submit to such the test. </li>
<li><strong>Refusing a breath test can result in a penalty</strong>: Under Illinois law, you impliedly consent to a breath test. If you refuse, you can lose your license for a period time under an administrative revocation.</li>
<li><strong>You do not have to consent to a search of your car</strong>: Sometimes police will ask if they can look in your car. You should tell them no. If the police had probable cause to search your vehicle, they would not ask you, they would simply do it. If they ask for permission, they do not have probable cause, and you do not have to let them look in your car. </li>
<li><strong>You may ask if you are free to go</strong>: If the traffic stop seems to be taking a long time, you may always ask “Officer, am I being detained or am I free to go?” </li>
<li><strong>You must sign the ticket</strong>: If you are given a ticket, accept it calmly and sign it when instructed to do so. Signing the ticket is not an admission of guilt. Refusing to sign the ticket can lead to your arrest.</ul>
</li>
<p>Remember that no matter what happens or what the police ask you, you should remain calm. Do not argue or swear. Your attitude can greatly affect the situation. </p>
<h3>Call a Lawyer Right Away</h3>
<p>If you are arrested or ticketed during a traffic stop, call the Chicago criminal defense attorneys at O’Meara Law right away. You have the right to an attorney at all times after you arrest. Simply say “I refuse to answer questions until I have an attorney present.” You cannot be punished for this and it is not an admission of guilty. </p>
<p>Call O’Meara Law at <strong><span class="ibp"> </span></strong> or use the online chat to schedule a consultation. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being pulled over for a DUI can be scary. If you have little or no experience with the police, you might be intimidated by the officer approaching your window. There are many ways this situation can go, but there’s no need for anyone to be hurt or become aggressive. When you know the best way to behave and you understand your rights in the situation, a traffic stop – even for something as serious as a DUI – can go smoothly. </p>
<p>If you were arrested for a DUI, contact a Chicago DUI defense lawyer with O’Meara Law at <strong><span class="ibp"> </span></strong> to learn how we can help you.  </p>
<h3>5 Tips for When You Are Pulled Over</h3>
<p>A traffic stop is never fun, but it can be a smooth process. There’s no need for it to be a terrifying experience. Keep these 5 tips in mind if you are ever pulled over:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Pull over to a safe place as soon as possible.</strong> When you see flashing lights behind you, the best thing to do is turn on your hazard lights or turn signal to let the police know you see them, and then slowly pull over to a safe spot. You want to make sure that you and the police cars will be out of the way of traffic on the shoulder or a side street. Do not continue to drive for a large distance or speed away. </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Turn off your car, switch on the dome light, roll down the window, and put your hands on the wheel.</strong> When the police stop a vehicle, they don’t know what they are going to encounter. They are typically concerned for their own safety. Certain steps show that you are cooperating with the stop and that you aren’t a threat to officers. Turn off your car to show you won’t flee. If it is night time or dark and you can easily turn on the dome light, you should do so. This lets the police see you and your actions better. The more they can see you, the less likely they are to misinterpret your movements. As the police approach the car, roll down the window and make sure your hands are firmly on the steering wheel so they know you aren’t trying to hide or reach for anything. </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explain your movements.</strong> Traffic stops generally begin with the officer asking for your driver’s license, registration, and insurance. When you need to move your hands from the wheel, tell the officers what you are about to do. Say something like, “I’m going to take my wallet out of my back pocket to get my license,” or “I’m going to open my glove compartment for my insurance card.” If you are asked to get out of the car, you should do so. Tell the officer that you are moving hands to unbuckle your seat or open the door. </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Speak calmly and carefully.</strong> If you have been pulled over and the police suspect you of a DUI, remain calm. If you become agitated, the officers will worry for their own safety, which can escalate the situation. Your dignity may be hurt at this point, but don’t raise your voice or argue with the officers. In a calm and clear voice, answer the questions or inform them that you are invoking your right to silence. Do not admit anything, particularly drinking. Saying more than you need to can look like an admission and be used against you later in court. </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Call a lawyer.</strong> As soon as you are able, call an attorney or a family member and ask them to get you a lawyer. Most traffic stops for a DUI are routine, and when you are calm, polite, and know your rights, there is no reason for anything to go wrong. You might not be happy if you’ve been arrested, but there are many defenses to fight a DUI. If you have questions about your DUI traffic stop and arrest, contact a Chicago DUI defense lawyer with O’Meara Law at <strong><span class="ibp"> </span></strong>. </li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all have a mental image of a typical field sobriety test – a man or woman walking in a straight line, someone balancing on one foot while touching the tip of their nose, or a police officer asking someone to say the alphabet backward. However, field sobriety tests aren’t like they appear in the movies. There are standards for how these tests should be administered and graded by the police. </p>
<p>If you were pulled over for a DUI and given a nonstandard test or graded differently than is required, you may be able to challenge the admissibility of the results of that test in court. You can also challenge the results if you believe they are unreliable due to a medical condition, prescribed medication, or another issue like fatigue. </p>
<p>To learn more about field sobriety tests and if you were treated fairly, contact the Chicago criminal defense attorneys of O’Meara Law at <strong><span class="ibp"> </span></strong>. </p>
<h3>What are Field Sobriety Tests? </h3>
<p>There is a lot of confusion out there about field sobriety tests and their purpose. In general, they are a type of psychophysical test which police use to find clues of physical or mental impairment. You’ll be asked to perform certain actions that can show whether you are physically or mentally impaired. For instance, you may be asked to stand still and follow the top of a pen or other object with your eyes without moving your head. This is known as the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) test, during which the police look at your voluntary and involuntary eye movement. </p>
<p>The theory behind field sobriety tests is that if you are too impaired to perform simple actions, you are too impaired to drive. However, many professionals believe these tests are awkward and allow for the police to find evidence of impairment when there is none. For instance, the HGN test is well-regarded, but people with medical conditions could do poorly on this test without being impaired. </p>
<h3>Standardized Testing</h3>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration created standards for the types of tests police should give during field sobriety testing, how police should administer the tests, how the driver’s actions should be interpreted, and whether the results should lead to an arrest or not. However, those standards are not always followed. Additionally, police officers sometimes use tests that are not standard due to personal preferences. </p>
<p>If you were given a field sobriety test, you should discuss with your attorney what it was and how it was administered. There may be evidence that it was an unstandardized test. Any evidence from this test that the police used to arrest you may not be admissible in court. Without this evidence, there may be little to no proof of impaired driving. </p>
<h3>Field Sobriety Tests are Voluntary</h3>
<p>With all of the questions surrounding field sobriety tests, it’s important for drivers to know that these tests are voluntary. If the police ask you to step out of the car, you must follow this direction. However, if the police ask you to perform other actions for field sobriety tests, you can calmly and politely say that you do not consent to taking any field sobriety tests. Keep in mind that the officer can still arrest you for a DUI, but he or she will not have additional evidence against you. If you do take one or more field sobriety tests, it will be harder to have this evidence ruled inadmissible or to fight it in court. </p>
<h3>How The Chicago DUI Defense Attorneys Can Help</h3>
<p>Field sobriety tests are controversial, and their results are questionable. If you were arrested for a DUI after performing a field sobriety test, call the Chicago criminal defense attorneys of O’Meara Law at <strong><span class="ibp"> </span></strong> to learn how you can challenge this evidence in court. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve ever had the misfortune of dealing with a DUI arrest, it may seem that in the blink of an eye you went from driving home to being handcuffed and put in the back of a police car.  When you are left to reflect in the back seat of a patrol car, you are probably wondering how your night went so wrong.</p>
<p>Illinois law enforcement takes <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/dui/"title="Chicago DUI">DUI charges</a> very seriously and would rather arrest anyone they suspect to be driving while impaired than let someone be a threat to public safety. But this vigorous enforcement of DUI law means that people like you can be arrested when they aren’t committing a crime. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s up to you to get through this DUI arrest and protect your own rights. If you were arrested for a DUI, don’t hesitate to call the Chicago DUI defense attorneys of <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/"title="Chicago Criminal Defense Lawyer">O’Meara Law</a> at <strong><span class="ibp"> </span></strong>. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Get an attorney immediately</strong>. After you are arrested and taken to the police station, you will be given the opportunity to contact someone regarding your arrest. The truth is that this may take some time and it isn’t just one phone call. You can have a reasonable number of calls to get ahold of someone. Call your attorney directly or speak with a family member who can call an attorney. A lawyer will guide you through questioning and ensure you are released from jail as soon as possible. </p>
<li>
<p><strong>Stay silent and ask for a lawyer</strong>. Everyone’s heard of their right to remain silent but many people don’t use it. Some people think cooperating means answering the police officers’ questions, even if they end up admitting to having a drink or two earlier in the day. Just remember: the police can use anything you say against you later in court. It is always safer to clearly refuse to answer any questions until your attorney is present. Don’t say you think you want an attorney or that you might need an attorney. State “I will not answer any questions until I have my attorney present.” Once you ask for an attorney, all police questioning must stop until you have your lawyer in the room with you. The police can’t use your silence against you.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not argue</strong>. People become confrontational after an arrest for a number of reasons. You’re nervous and scared or even outraged when you’ve been arrested for a crime you didn’t commit. But the police station is not the time to argue your case – you and your attorney will have the opportunity to do that later in court with the prosecutor. Disagreeing with the police, even if you believe you’re being polite, can result in the police using what you say against you and treating you as a threat to their safety.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Refuse a warrantless blood test</strong>. When you are arrested for a DUI, the police may ask you to take a <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/dui/dui-testing/"title="DUI Testing">blood test</a>. This can give them a more accurate reading of your BAC at the time of the arrest. You are not required to submit to this test. The police must obtain a valid warrant for this test before they can require you to take it. A valid warrant will have a description of what is required and a judge or magistrate’s signature.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You will be released on bail</strong>. You will be released on a bail bond, which is an amount of money that is refunded – minus fees – when you return for your trial. The amount of your bail will be set by the judge who will consider the circumstances of the DUI and your financial ability. You, a family member, or a friend must pay 10 percent of the bail amount to secure your release – your attorney can’t pay it for you. You will only have to pay the remaining 90 percent if you fail to appear in court or violate a condition of the bond.</ol>
</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, you can be charged with a DUI even if a breath test shows a blood alcohol content (BAC) level under .08 percent. Many people believe that the only way to be arrested for a DUI is to have been drinking alcohol and blow a .08 percent or higher on a breathalyzer. However, there’s much more to a DUI than your BAC. If you were charged with a DUI despite blowing less than a .08 percent, call a <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/dui/" title="DUI Defense">Chicago DUI defense lawyer</a> with O’Meara Law at <strong><span class="ibp"> </span></strong>. </p>
<h3>Illinois DUI Law</h3>
<p>People may concentrate on the 0.08 BAC standard, but the truth is that the law describes a variety of actions that can lead to a DUI conviction. Illinois law <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs4.asp?DocName=062500050HCh%2E+11+Art%2E+V&#038;ActID=1815&#038;ChapterID=49&#038;SeqStart=116700000&#038;SeqEnd=118800000" title="625 ILCS 5/11-501" target="_blank">625 ILCS 5/11-501</a> states a person should not drive or be in control of any vehicle if he or she:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has a BAC of .08 percent or more</li>
<li>Is under the influence of alcohol</li>
<li>Is under the influence of an intoxicating compound or combination of intoxicating compounds to a degree that renders a person incapable of driving safely</li>
<li>Is under the influence of any other drug or combination of drugs to a degree that renders a person incapable of driving safely</li>
<li>Is under the combined influence of alcohol, drugs, or intoxicating compounds</li>
<li>Has any amount of drug, substance, or compound on their breath, blood, or urine resulting from the unlawful consumption of a controlled substance like cannabis or methamphetamine</li>
</ul>
<h3>Marijuana Can Lead to a DUI</h3>
<p>If you consumer marijuana, your perception and physical abilities may be altered. This could lead to a DUI. If an officer sees or smells marijuana in your vehicle, he or she automatically has probable cause to believe you’ve consumed it illegally. Even if there are no other signs of impairment, that’s enough to arrest you for a DUI.  </p>
<p>If you lawfully used marijuana for a medical reason, you can still be convicted of a DUI if the cannabis impaired your abilities to drive safely. If you were arrested for marijuana use but you were not impaired, you will need to work with an experienced Chicago DUI defense lawyer to prove your innocence. Your attorney will strive to show the prosecutor that you did not pose a danger on the road. </p>
<h3>Medications Can Cause a DUI</h3>
<p>Many people consume drugs other than alcohol and marijuana. Some of these drugs are illegal, controlled substances, but many times they are prescribed or over-the-counter medications. There are a great deal of medications that can alter a person’s abilities. Opioid painkillers are commonly prescribed for people who suffer from acute or long-term pain, but can be unsafe to drive depending on the individual’s reaction. Popular medications like Benadryl for allergies can make people incredibly drowsy. </p>
<p>It is possible to be arrested for a DUI because of the effects of completely legal drugs. The basis of the charge is not necessary the medication you took, but the effect that medication had on your physical and mental capabilities. </p>
<h3>Contact a Chicago DUI Defense Lawyer</h3>
<p>Facing a DUI based on any reason is a challenge, but it’s particularly scary when you feel like you did nothing wrong. Attorney Michael O’Meara understands that charges can arise from simple mistakes, which is why he will fight tenaciously for your rights in court. As a former prosecutor, Michael O’Meara understands the nuances of DUI charges and offenses. He knows how to work to have your charges dropped or get the best results possible for the situation.</p>
