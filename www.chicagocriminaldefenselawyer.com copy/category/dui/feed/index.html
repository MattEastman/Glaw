				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The State of Illinois takes a tough stance on drinking and driving, and with good reason. In 2014, 281 people in Illinois lost their lives in crashes that occurred because someone was drinking and driving. Around 30% of all fatal crashes involve alcohol, so the authorities view the fight against drunk driving as a priority.</p>
<p>To make the roads safer, the Illinois legislature has gone a step farther than outlawing driving under the influence (DUI). It is also illegal to have an open alcohol container anywhere in the vehicle’s driver or passenger area—regardless of whether the driver or any passengers are actually intoxicated.</p>
<p>While not as serious as a <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/dui/dui-conviction-effects/" title="DUI Conviction">DUI conviction</a>, driving with an open container will seriously affect your finances and driving record. With 3,569 convictions in 2014 alone, illegal transportation of alcohol is a common offense in Illinois. Many of the accused simply plead guilty to the charges without a fight. But by hiring an experienced Chicago criminal defense attorney, you may be able to avoid the penalties for driving with an open container.</p>
<h3>What Are the Penalties for Driving with an Open Container?</h3>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=062500050K11-502" title="Transportation or possession of alcoholic liquor in a motor vehicle" target="_blank">section 11-502 of the Illinois Vehicle Code</a>, it is illegal for someone to transport, carry, possess or have an open alcohol container in the passenger area of a vehicle on any highway in Illinois. The alcoholic beverage container is considered to be open whenever the seal is broken. If you have an unsealed water bottle or other container containing any amount of alcohol, you may be charged—even if you haven’t had a sip. </p>
<p>The only exception to the rule against open containers involves limousines, chartered buses, and motor homes, where it is legal for open containers to be present in the separate passenger area of the vehicle. Of course, it is still illegal for the driver to have access to an open container. </p>
<p>Driving with an open container is charged as a petty offense—the least serious category of criminal offenses. Nonetheless, the penalties may be harsh. If convicted, you may face up to $1,000 in fines and possible jail time in egregious cases. In addition, you will face a suspended license—unless it’s you second conviction within a single year, in which case your license will get revoked. </p>
<h3>How Can an Illinois Criminal Defense Lawyer Help?</h3>
<p>To convict you of illegally transporting alcohol, the state prosecutor will need to present evidence that proves beyond a reasonable doubt that you had an open container in your vehicle’s passenger area. The evidence will likely be the arresting officer’s observations during the traffic stop and any open containers visible in plain sight or found during a search of your vehicle. </p>
<p>Your lawyer can ask the judge to remove this evidence from the prosecutor’s case when:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The police stopped you without probable cause</strong> — The police can’t just pull you over on the hunch that they will catch you doing something wrong. The police can only stop your car if they have a warrant or if there is a reason to believe that you are doing something illegal. Any evidence from an illegal traffic stop must be removed from the prosecutor’s case.</li>
<li><strong>The arresting officer performed an unreasonable vehicle search</strong> — If the police see an open container in plain sight, such as on your seat, the prosecutor can use that evidence. But only under some circumstances are the police allowed to search your vehicle for contraband. If the police didn’t have your consent or probable cause to search your vehicle, the evidence obtained from that search must be excluded from the case.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being pulled over for a DUI can be scary. If you have little or no experience with the police, you might be intimidated by the officer approaching your window. There are many ways this situation can go, but there’s no need for anyone to be hurt or become aggressive. When you know the best way to behave and you understand your rights in the situation, a traffic stop – even for something as serious as a DUI – can go smoothly. </p>
<p>If you were arrested for a DUI, contact a Chicago DUI defense lawyer with O’Meara Law at <strong><span class="ibp"> </span></strong> to learn how we can help you.  </p>
<h3>5 Tips for When You Are Pulled Over</h3>
<p>A traffic stop is never fun, but it can be a smooth process. There’s no need for it to be a terrifying experience. Keep these 5 tips in mind if you are ever pulled over:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Pull over to a safe place as soon as possible.</strong> When you see flashing lights behind you, the best thing to do is turn on your hazard lights or turn signal to let the police know you see them, and then slowly pull over to a safe spot. You want to make sure that you and the police cars will be out of the way of traffic on the shoulder or a side street. Do not continue to drive for a large distance or speed away. </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Turn off your car, switch on the dome light, roll down the window, and put your hands on the wheel.</strong> When the police stop a vehicle, they don’t know what they are going to encounter. They are typically concerned for their own safety. Certain steps show that you are cooperating with the stop and that you aren’t a threat to officers. Turn off your car to show you won’t flee. If it is night time or dark and you can easily turn on the dome light, you should do so. This lets the police see you and your actions better. The more they can see you, the less likely they are to misinterpret your movements. As the police approach the car, roll down the window and make sure your hands are firmly on the steering wheel so they know you aren’t trying to hide or reach for anything. </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explain your movements.</strong> Traffic stops generally begin with the officer asking for your driver’s license, registration, and insurance. When you need to move your hands from the wheel, tell the officers what you are about to do. Say something like, “I’m going to take my wallet out of my back pocket to get my license,” or “I’m going to open my glove compartment for my insurance card.” If you are asked to get out of the car, you should do so. Tell the officer that you are moving hands to unbuckle your seat or open the door. </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Speak calmly and carefully.</strong> If you have been pulled over and the police suspect you of a DUI, remain calm. If you become agitated, the officers will worry for their own safety, which can escalate the situation. Your dignity may be hurt at this point, but don’t raise your voice or argue with the officers. In a calm and clear voice, answer the questions or inform them that you are invoking your right to silence. Do not admit anything, particularly drinking. Saying more than you need to can look like an admission and be used against you later in court. </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Call a lawyer.</strong> As soon as you are able, call an attorney or a family member and ask them to get you a lawyer. Most traffic stops for a DUI are routine, and when you are calm, polite, and know your rights, there is no reason for anything to go wrong. You might not be happy if you’ve been arrested, but there are many defenses to fight a DUI. If you have questions about your DUI traffic stop and arrest, contact a Chicago DUI defense lawyer with O’Meara Law at <strong><span class="ibp"> </span></strong>. </li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all have a mental image of a typical field sobriety test – a man or woman walking in a straight line, someone balancing on one foot while touching the tip of their nose, or a police officer asking someone to say the alphabet backward. However, field sobriety tests aren’t like they appear in the movies. There are standards for how these tests should be administered and graded by the police. </p>
<p>If you were pulled over for a DUI and given a nonstandard test or graded differently than is required, you may be able to challenge the admissibility of the results of that test in court. You can also challenge the results if you believe they are unreliable due to a medical condition, prescribed medication, or another issue like fatigue. </p>
<p>To learn more about field sobriety tests and if you were treated fairly, contact the Chicago criminal defense attorneys of O’Meara Law at <strong><span class="ibp"> </span></strong>. </p>
<h3>What are Field Sobriety Tests? </h3>
<p>There is a lot of confusion out there about field sobriety tests and their purpose. In general, they are a type of psychophysical test which police use to find clues of physical or mental impairment. You’ll be asked to perform certain actions that can show whether you are physically or mentally impaired. For instance, you may be asked to stand still and follow the top of a pen or other object with your eyes without moving your head. This is known as the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) test, during which the police look at your voluntary and involuntary eye movement. </p>
<p>The theory behind field sobriety tests is that if you are too impaired to perform simple actions, you are too impaired to drive. However, many professionals believe these tests are awkward and allow for the police to find evidence of impairment when there is none. For instance, the HGN test is well-regarded, but people with medical conditions could do poorly on this test without being impaired. </p>
<h3>Standardized Testing</h3>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration created standards for the types of tests police should give during field sobriety testing, how police should administer the tests, how the driver’s actions should be interpreted, and whether the results should lead to an arrest or not. However, those standards are not always followed. Additionally, police officers sometimes use tests that are not standard due to personal preferences. </p>
<p>If you were given a field sobriety test, you should discuss with your attorney what it was and how it was administered. There may be evidence that it was an unstandardized test. Any evidence from this test that the police used to arrest you may not be admissible in court. Without this evidence, there may be little to no proof of impaired driving. </p>
<h3>Field Sobriety Tests are Voluntary</h3>
<p>With all of the questions surrounding field sobriety tests, it’s important for drivers to know that these tests are voluntary. If the police ask you to step out of the car, you must follow this direction. However, if the police ask you to perform other actions for field sobriety tests, you can calmly and politely say that you do not consent to taking any field sobriety tests. Keep in mind that the officer can still arrest you for a DUI, but he or she will not have additional evidence against you. If you do take one or more field sobriety tests, it will be harder to have this evidence ruled inadmissible or to fight it in court. </p>
<h3>How The Chicago DUI Defense Attorneys Can Help</h3>
<p>Field sobriety tests are controversial, and their results are questionable. If you were arrested for a DUI after performing a field sobriety test, call the Chicago criminal defense attorneys of O’Meara Law at <strong><span class="ibp"> </span></strong> to learn how you can challenge this evidence in court. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve ever had the misfortune of dealing with a DUI arrest, it may seem that in the blink of an eye you went from driving home to being handcuffed and put in the back of a police car.  When you are left to reflect in the back seat of a patrol car, you are probably wondering how your night went so wrong.</p>
<p>Illinois law enforcement takes <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/dui/"title="Chicago DUI">DUI charges</a> very seriously and would rather arrest anyone they suspect to be driving while impaired than let someone be a threat to public safety. But this vigorous enforcement of DUI law means that people like you can be arrested when they aren’t committing a crime. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s up to you to get through this DUI arrest and protect your own rights. If you were arrested for a DUI, don’t hesitate to call the Chicago DUI defense attorneys of <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/"title="Chicago Criminal Defense Lawyer">O’Meara Law</a> at <strong><span class="ibp"> </span></strong>. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Get an attorney immediately</strong>. After you are arrested and taken to the police station, you will be given the opportunity to contact someone regarding your arrest. The truth is that this may take some time and it isn’t just one phone call. You can have a reasonable number of calls to get ahold of someone. Call your attorney directly or speak with a family member who can call an attorney. A lawyer will guide you through questioning and ensure you are released from jail as soon as possible. </p>
<li>
<p><strong>Stay silent and ask for a lawyer</strong>. Everyone’s heard of their right to remain silent but many people don’t use it. Some people think cooperating means answering the police officers’ questions, even if they end up admitting to having a drink or two earlier in the day. Just remember: the police can use anything you say against you later in court. It is always safer to clearly refuse to answer any questions until your attorney is present. Don’t say you think you want an attorney or that you might need an attorney. State “I will not answer any questions until I have my attorney present.” Once you ask for an attorney, all police questioning must stop until you have your lawyer in the room with you. The police can’t use your silence against you.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not argue</strong>. People become confrontational after an arrest for a number of reasons. You’re nervous and scared or even outraged when you’ve been arrested for a crime you didn’t commit. But the police station is not the time to argue your case – you and your attorney will have the opportunity to do that later in court with the prosecutor. Disagreeing with the police, even if you believe you’re being polite, can result in the police using what you say against you and treating you as a threat to their safety.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Refuse a warrantless blood test</strong>. When you are arrested for a DUI, the police may ask you to take a <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/dui/dui-testing/"title="DUI Testing">blood test</a>. This can give them a more accurate reading of your BAC at the time of the arrest. You are not required to submit to this test. The police must obtain a valid warrant for this test before they can require you to take it. A valid warrant will have a description of what is required and a judge or magistrate’s signature.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You will be released on bail</strong>. You will be released on a bail bond, which is an amount of money that is refunded – minus fees – when you return for your trial. The amount of your bail will be set by the judge who will consider the circumstances of the DUI and your financial ability. You, a family member, or a friend must pay 10 percent of the bail amount to secure your release – your attorney can’t pay it for you. You will only have to pay the remaining 90 percent if you fail to appear in court or violate a condition of the bond.</ol>
</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, you can be charged with a DUI even if a breath test shows a blood alcohol content (BAC) level under .08 percent. Many people believe that the only way to be arrested for a DUI is to have been drinking alcohol and blow a .08 percent or higher on a breathalyzer. However, there’s much more to a DUI than your BAC. If you were charged with a DUI despite blowing less than a .08 percent, call a <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/dui/" title="DUI Defense">Chicago DUI defense lawyer</a> with O’Meara Law at <strong><span class="ibp"> </span></strong>. </p>
<h3>Illinois DUI Law</h3>
<p>People may concentrate on the 0.08 BAC standard, but the truth is that the law describes a variety of actions that can lead to a DUI conviction. Illinois law <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs4.asp?DocName=062500050HCh%2E+11+Art%2E+V&#038;ActID=1815&#038;ChapterID=49&#038;SeqStart=116700000&#038;SeqEnd=118800000" title="625 ILCS 5/11-501" target="_blank">625 ILCS 5/11-501</a> states a person should not drive or be in control of any vehicle if he or she:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has a BAC of .08 percent or more</li>
<li>Is under the influence of alcohol</li>
<li>Is under the influence of an intoxicating compound or combination of intoxicating compounds to a degree that renders a person incapable of driving safely</li>
<li>Is under the influence of any other drug or combination of drugs to a degree that renders a person incapable of driving safely</li>
<li>Is under the combined influence of alcohol, drugs, or intoxicating compounds</li>
<li>Has any amount of drug, substance, or compound on their breath, blood, or urine resulting from the unlawful consumption of a controlled substance like cannabis or methamphetamine</li>
</ul>
<h3>Marijuana Can Lead to a DUI</h3>
<p>If you consumer marijuana, your perception and physical abilities may be altered. This could lead to a DUI. If an officer sees or smells marijuana in your vehicle, he or she automatically has probable cause to believe you’ve consumed it illegally. Even if there are no other signs of impairment, that’s enough to arrest you for a DUI.  </p>
<p>If you lawfully used marijuana for a medical reason, you can still be convicted of a DUI if the cannabis impaired your abilities to drive safely. If you were arrested for marijuana use but you were not impaired, you will need to work with an experienced Chicago DUI defense lawyer to prove your innocence. Your attorney will strive to show the prosecutor that you did not pose a danger on the road. </p>
<h3>Medications Can Cause a DUI</h3>
<p>Many people consume drugs other than alcohol and marijuana. Some of these drugs are illegal, controlled substances, but many times they are prescribed or over-the-counter medications. There are a great deal of medications that can alter a person’s abilities. Opioid painkillers are commonly prescribed for people who suffer from acute or long-term pain, but can be unsafe to drive depending on the individual’s reaction. Popular medications like Benadryl for allergies can make people incredibly drowsy. </p>
<p>It is possible to be arrested for a DUI because of the effects of completely legal drugs. The basis of the charge is not necessary the medication you took, but the effect that medication had on your physical and mental capabilities. </p>
<h3>Contact a Chicago DUI Defense Lawyer</h3>
<p>Facing a DUI based on any reason is a challenge, but it’s particularly scary when you feel like you did nothing wrong. Attorney Michael O’Meara understands that charges can arise from simple mistakes, which is why he will fight tenaciously for your rights in court. As a former prosecutor, Michael O’Meara understands the nuances of DUI charges and offenses. He knows how to work to have your charges dropped or get the best results possible for the situation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Driving under the influence is dangerous, but operating an aircraft while intoxicated often turns deadly. Flying under the influence can lead to serious consequences. Recently, an <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/american-airlines-pilot-arrested-failing-breathalyzer-test-detroit/story?id=37949289" target="_blank">American Airlines co-pilot was arrested</a> at the airport before takeoff because he failed a Breathalyzer test. His blood alcohol content level measured above the legal limit of 0.04 percent. As a result, the flight was cancelled, and the pilot will most likely lose his license. </p>

<li>Being under the influence of alcohol or drugs</li>
<li>Having a blood alcohol content of 0.04 percent or higher</li>
<li>Using any illicit drug or prescription drug that inhibits ability to function</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are suspected of being intoxicated prior to or during a flight, you will be asked to submit to testing under the implied consent law. If you are found to be in violation of FAA rules, you may be subject to penalties similar to <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/dui/">DUI offenses</a>, or worse.

<li>License suspension or revocation</li>
<li>Alcohol rehabilitation programs</li>
<li>Loss of employment</li>

<p>In addition, you can face more serious charges if your actions caused an accident that results in injury to another person or property. An aggravated FUI offense can lead to a <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/dui/felony-dui/">felony conviction</a>, punishable by up to 15 years in prison. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DUI checkpoints in Chicago are currently legal and active. Also known as roadblocks or mobile checkpoints, these designated stops allow police officers to protect the public from potentially inebriated drivers. Police can randomly stop and question vehicle occupants passing through a checkpoint, and conduct sobriety tests on suspicious drivers. According to the Center for Disease Control, DUI checkpoints can contribute to preventing ten percent of DUI-related fatalities. Common DUI checkpoints in Chicago include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grand Ave and Park Ave</li>
<li>Grand Crossing Area</li>
<li>Wentworth Area</li>
<li>Dan Ryan Expressway</li>
</ul>
<p>It is required in Illinois to publicize the checkpoints ahead of time.  You can learn more about when and where the chosen spots are at roadblock.org. </p>
<h3>What Happens If You Are Detained at a DUI Checkpoint?</h3>
<p>Being detained at a Chicago DUI checkpoint for the first time can feel scary and overwhelming. You may or may not have been drinking prior to taking the wheel of a car. Regardless of the situation, you are still entitled to certain rights, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right to Remain Silent:</strong> While you must show valid license and registration to the responding officer, you do not need to answer questions if you feel uncomfortable. </li>
<li><strong>Right Against Illegal Search and Seizure:</strong> The police do not have permission to search your vehicle without probable cause. </li>
<li><strong>Right to an Attorney:</strong> If you are arrested on a DUI-related charge, you should contact an experienced Chicago DUI defense lawyer immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>Officers typically look for signs of intoxication, such as slurred speech, bloodshot eyes, or hints of alcohol on your breath. You may be asked to subject to a standard field sobriety test. However, if you refuse this test, the officer may still be able to arrest you based on his observations. In addition, you may be asked to take a Breathalyzer test. Under the implied consent rule, refusing a Breathalyzer can lead to one year of license suspension for a first offense, or three years of license suspension for multi-offense. </p>
<p>Penalties for a drunk driving offense can be severe in Illinois. You may lose your license, have to pay hefty fines, or even end up in jail. When you are charged with a DUI offense in Chicago, having the right <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/dui/">Chicago DUI defense lawyer</a> by your side can make a huge difference. A skilled attorney can help negotiate with the prosecutor or judge, and potentially get your charges dropped. </p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_157800.html" target="_blank">study</a> by the Mayo Clinic, med students may be at greater risk for alcohol abuse. Due to the high stress and burnout rate associated with medical school, students often turn to alcohol for relief. In fact, almost a third of medical students surveyed reported dependence on alcohol. Some factors that contribute to stress and burnout include:</p>
<ul>
<li>High educational debt</li>
<li>Emotional exhaustion</li>
<li>Pressure to succeed</li>
<li>Depression </li>
<li>Poor health and wellness</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, alcohol abuse may also lead to increased instances of driving under the influence. This phenomenon is particularly relevant for young and unmarried medical students, who are more likely to attend parties and drinking events after classes and exams. However, when you are caught driving while intoxicated, the consequences can be severe. You may be expelled from medical school, and charged with a criminal offense.  </p>
<h3>Chicago Drunk Driving Offenses </h3>
<p>Whether you are cruising around University of Chicago’s campus, or coming back from an event at Loyola University, getting behind the driver’s seat after consuming alcoholic beverages can be dangerous and illegal. If a local police officer suspects that you are driving under the influence, he can pull you over, and ask you to take a Breathalyzer or roadside sobriety test. Even when you do not feel intoxicated, your blood alcohol content level may be over the permitted 0.08 percent limit. </p>
<p>A DUI offense is considered a serious crime in Chicago, and upon conviction, you can be subject to harsh penalties, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jail time (up to one year for first offense)</li>
<li>Fines up to $2,500</li>
<li>License suspension</li>
<li>Permanent criminal record</li>
<li>Community service</li>
<li>Alcohol abuse or treatment programs </li>
<li>Significant increase in insurance rates</li>
<li>Civil liabilities (for aggravated DUI offenses that cause injury to someone else)</li>
</ul>
<p>A Chicago drunk driving conviction can completely damage your future medical career and reputation. That’s why, when you are charged, you should consult with an experienced Chicago DUI defense attorney as soon as possible. </p>
<h3>How a Chicago DUI Defense Lawyer Can Help </h3>
<p>Chicago DUI cases can quickly become complicated, especially if your actions injured someone else. Having the right Chicago DUI defense lawyer on your side will be helpful on many levels. A skilled attorney will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain the charges against you</li>
<li>Build a solid plan of defense</li>
<li>Apply Illinois court rules to your advantage</li>
<li>Potentially rule out evidence that was improperly collected</li>
<li>Potentially reduce or reverse your charges</li>
<li>Negotiate with the prosecutor or judge for reduce sentencing</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few things are as stressful as getting charged with a crime. From the humiliation of getting arrested, to the inconvenience of court appearances, to the prospect of jail time and fines, facing the <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/criminal-defense/">criminal justice system</a> can turn your life upside down. If you get convicted of a crime, you will get a permanent entry on your criminal record that can keep you from getting a job, owning a firearm, or going to school. </p>
<p>Fortunately, a skilled Chicago criminal defense attorney working at your side can help you avoid the harshest consequences of a criminal conviction. He or she may be able to obtain the dismissal of your charges, a victory at trial, or a deal with the prosecutor for a conviction of a lesser crime. And even if you do get a conviction, your crime may qualify for the expungement or sealing of your criminal record.</p>
<h3>Don’t Give Up Hope If You’ve Been Charged With a Crime</h3>
<p>Your lawyer may be able to have the charges against you dismissed, which means that you “win” your case even before it goes to trial. The prosecutor must have enough evidence in his or her case to make it worth the state’s time and money to put you on trial. If your lawyer can convince the judge that there isn’t enough evidence against you, your charges may get dismissed. </p>
<p>One strategy for obtaining the dismissal of your charges is filing a motion to suppress the prosecution’s evidence. If the motion to suppress is successful, the judge will order that some pieces of the prosecution’s evidence be removed from the case. When this happens, the prosecutor is often left without enough evidence to make a case against you. This leaves your lawyer in a position to request the dismissal of your charges.</p>
<h3>Your Lawyer Can Challenge the Prosecutor’s Evidence Against You</h3>
<p>Filing a motion to suppress the prosecution’s evidence may be an option in your case in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The police failed to respect your Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. For example, they searched your house without a warrant or pulled your car over without reasonable suspicion you were committing a crime.</li>
<li>The police denied your Fifth Amendment right to remain silent by failing to inform you that your words could and would be used against you.</li>
<li>You clearly requested that you wanted a lawyer but the police continued to interrogate you and obtained incriminating statements—which violates your Sixth Amendment Rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>If successful, the motion to suppress will result in the removal of any evidence obtained because of the authorities’ illegal conduct.</p>
<h3>You Can Beat the Prosecution’s Charges at Trial</h3>
<p>The prosecution must prove every element of its case beyond a reasonable doubt. This means that if you’ve been charged with drug possession, for example, the prosecution must present evidence that is so convincing that no reasonable person could doubt that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You had a controlled substance in your possession or under your control</li>
<li>You knew that the substance was illegal</li>
<li>The substance was actually illegal</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a difficult burden to meet. If your lawyer can show that there is some doubt as to even one of these elements, the jury will be instructed to enter a verdict of not guilty. For example, if your lawyer presents evidence that the equipment used to test the drugs was deficient, or that the crime lab has a history of not following procedures, there may be a reasonable doubt as to whether the substance in your possession was an illegal drug. </p>
<h3>A Good Lawyer Can Get You on the Jury’s Good Side</h3>
<p>Juries do not always follow the judge’s instructions. If the defense has proved there is a reasonable doubt as to an element of the prosecution’s case, the jury still has the ability to enter a verdict of guilty—in defiance of the judge’s instructions. In fact, some legal professionals believe that most juries utterly disregard their instructions and come to their conclusions based on their gut feeling—or prejudices. </p>
<p>Conversely, juries may be persuaded to enter a verdict of not-guilty even when the evidence overwhelmingly points towards your guilt. One of the most famous examples of a jury’s ability to derail the prosecution is the trial of OJ Simpson, who received a verdict of not guilty from a jury that deeply sympathized with him—despite the fact that he almost certainly was guilty. </p>
<p>A lawyer’s ability to portray you as a good person fighting an unfair criminal justice system can have a strong effect on the jury. Your attorney’s charisma and ability to tell a story is often just as important as his or her knowledge of the law. Attorney Michael S. O’Meara has both the experience and trial advocacy skills to get you excellent results when facing criminal charges. </p>
<h3>How a Chicago Criminal Defense Attorney Can Help You</h3>
<p>Although you don’t need a lawyer to obtain the sealing or expungement of your criminal records, your chances of success will be greater if you hire one to file the petition on your behalf. To learn more about expungement, record sealing, or how to defend against your criminal charges, call Chicago criminal defense lawyer Mike O’Meara today at <strong><span class="ibp"> </span></strong> for a free and confidential consultation of your case. </p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve been pulled over and charged with a drug crime, you should hire a skilled Chicago criminal defense attorney immediately. Do not talk to the police before consulting with your lawyer and do not accept a guilty plea, no matter how attractive it may seem. If the police pulled you over, conducted a search, and then arrested you, there is a good chance your lawyer can fight the charges if you act quickly.</p>
<p>Every person on American soil benefits from the protection of the US Constitution—regardless of his or her citizenship. These rights apply from the moment police initiate contact to the final stages of the criminal trial. This article will describe the rights of a drug crime suspect at various stages of a traffic stop, and explain how a skilled lawyer can defend your drug crime case. </p>
<h3>Challenging the Basis for the Traffic Stop</h3>
<p>The police cannot arbitrarily stop drivers. They must act on “reasonable suspicion” that the driver has committed a crime. This means that the police cannot pull you over on the mere hunch that you’ve done something illegal. Instead, they must have reason to believe you’ve committed a crime or a traffic violation such as driving with an expired tag or broken taillight.</p>
<p>It is actually quite difficult for the police to justify pulling you over on the suspicion that you are committing a drug crime, unless they had a tip from an informant or saw you doing drugs before or while you were driving. If the officer suspected you of being intoxicated based on your driving, your lawyer can make the case that your erratic or abnormal driving had an innocent explanation such as drowsiness or a mechanical issue with your vehicle.</p>
<p>If there was no reasonable suspicion justifying the initial <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/traffic-violations/">traffic stop</a> that led to your arrest, your lawyer may be able to have your drug charges dismissed—even if the police searched your vehicle and found drugs. This is because the prosecutor’s office cannot use evidence obtained from an illegal traffic stop in its case against you.</p>
<h3>Claiming that the Search of your Vehicle or Person Was Unreasonable</h3>
<p>Assuming the officer who pulled you over had a reasonable suspicion to do so, you may still be able to avoid a conviction for your drug crime charges. When the police are conducting a traffic search based on reasonable suspicion, they can only detain a suspect for the amount of time necessary to confirm or deny their suspicions that a crime is being committed. </p>
<p>For example, if you were speeding, the officer should have let you go after giving you a ticket or a warning—unless the officer gained probable cause that you were committing an additional crime. Probable cause is a slightly higher standard than the reasonable suspicion standard the officer needed to justify pulling you over. This means that the prosecutor will have a tougher time convincing the jury that the police had good reason to suspect you of criminal behavior at this stage of the encounter, after the initial traffic stop.  </p>
<p>If you say or do things that give the officer probable cause to believe that you’re high or in possession of drugs, the officer may detain you longer and investigate his or her suspicions by searching you or your vehicle. This is why you should always (calmly and politely) exercise your 5th amendment right to remain silent during a police encounter. Anything you say—or even the way in which you say it—could give the officer reason to believe you are high or in possession of drugs. </p>
<p>The police will also be justified in searching your vehicle if they see illegal items in plain sight, such as a weed pipe or a bag of drugs on your car seat. The odor of <a jref="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/drug-crimes/marijuana/">marijuana</a> has also been ruled to be a sufficient source of probable cause to search a vehicle during an Illinois traffic stop. Finally, the police can search your vehicle if a drug dog marks your vehicle. The police do not need probable cause to use a drug dog on your car, but they cannot make you wait an unreasonable amount of time for the drug dog to arrive.</p>
<h3>Obtaining the Dismissal of your Drug Crime Charges</h3>
<p>To summarize, a traffic stop can result in legitimate <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/drug-crimes/marijuana/">drug crime charges</a> when the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>The initial traffic stop was based on the reasonable suspicion that you were committing a crime (whether related to drugs or not)</li>
<li>The officer gained reasonable cause to believe you were committing a drug crime over the course of the traffic stop because: you said something incriminating; the officer smelled drugs; the officer saw drugs in plain sight; OR a drug dog marked your car</li>
<li>The officer searched you or your vehicle and obtained incriminating evidence based on a source of probable cause enumerated above, or because you consented to the search </li>
<li>The officer who arrested you explained that you have a right to an attorney and to remain silent, and that any statement you make can be used against you</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the circumstances under which a police officer can legally pull a suspect over, search for drugs, and gain the basis for making an arrest are fairly narrow. This means that if your charges resulted from a similar scenario, you should consult with an experienced attorney who may be able to have the charges dismissed even before your trial starts. </p>
<p>Your lawyer may be able to have the evidence against you removed from the prosecution’s case by filing a motion to suppress. The motion to suppress will likely be successful when the prosecutor’s evidence was obtained in violation of your constitutional right to be free form unreasonable searches and seizures. Sometimes, a successful motion to suppress will leave the prosecutor with so little admissible evidence against you that your lawyer can then file for a motion to dismiss the charges. </p>
