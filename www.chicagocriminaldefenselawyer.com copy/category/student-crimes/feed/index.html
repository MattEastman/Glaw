				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting a college education is a big part of the American dream. But if you made a mistake in the past, however small, and it led to a criminal conviction, your chance of that American dream can be shattered. It is commonplace for colleges and university to check into the criminal history of prospective students and to deny entry due to any past conviction, even minor offenses like a marijuana charge. But that might be changing soon.</p>
<h3>Illinois Moves Forward with Revolutionary Law</h3>
<p>There is now legislation heading to the General Assembly of Illinois to prevent schools from doing criminal background checks on prospective students. The bill, which was proposed by Rep. Barbara Wheeler, gained a tremendous amount of support at the committee level and is now on its way to the full house.</p>
<p>The purpose behind the bill is to give students with a criminal past a fresh start. There is no doubt that education is a great opportunity and a gateway to a fulfilling career that will contribute to the economy of the state and the country. If made into law, students with criminal past applying to colleges will do so freely without having their past and repaired behavior stifling their chances of a promising future.</p>
<p>But the proposed legislation comes with a small qualifier. Schools can do the necessary criminal checks after admission. It is not clear yet, how knowledge of past criminal behavior will affect a student&#8217;s continued enrollment.</p>
<h3>Is This a Bad Move?</h3>
<p>While the bill received a 16-1 favorable vote at the committee level, it is expected to gather some opposition as it makes its way through the legislative process. While proponents of the bill see it as a way to remove roadblocks from getting an education, there are many who view the proposal as a bad idea.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that schools see an obvious advantage and purpose to checking into the criminal background of prospective students. Paramount to many school administration is the safety of students, faculty and other members of staff on their campus. After all, a criminal pass can include a conviction for crimes that portrays an individual that has the propensity to display violent behavior.</p>
<p>However, this proposed legislation supports some of the key principles of the criminal justice system. Of utmost importance is the fact that once an individual has served his or her sentence, society should cease to punish that person, especially in relation to pursuing an education which can only be of benefit to the rehabilitation of a past offender. Further, past criminal behavior is not an indication of such actions in the future, as much as no criminal record is not an indication that there will be no criminal propensity in the future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent months, the Illinois State Police crime lab has been experiencing a significant delay in processing evidence collected in <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/sex-crimes/">rape</a> and murder crimes. The combination of limited resources and increasing test submissions has led to a backlog of nearly 3,100 cases. These tests include blood, semen, and other DNA samples that can potentially lead to arrests. </p>
<p>The State Department hopes to gather more funding soon to hire additional lab staff, and eliminate the DNA backlog. Once the untested evidence is processed, samples from unknown offenders can be compared to the database of known criminals. As a result, many pending cases may finally start to move forward.</p>
<p>However, some DNA samples have been stored away for decades. Because of the long delay in processing, pieces of evidence may become damaged, and result in inaccurate testing or compromised results.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_157800.html" target="_blank">study</a> by the Mayo Clinic, med students may be at greater risk for alcohol abuse. Due to the high stress and burnout rate associated with medical school, students often turn to alcohol for relief. In fact, almost a third of medical students surveyed reported dependence on alcohol. Some factors that contribute to stress and burnout include:</p>
<ul>
<li>High educational debt</li>
<li>Emotional exhaustion</li>
<li>Pressure to succeed</li>
<li>Depression </li>
<li>Poor health and wellness</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, alcohol abuse may also lead to increased instances of driving under the influence. This phenomenon is particularly relevant for young and unmarried medical students, who are more likely to attend parties and drinking events after classes and exams. However, when you are caught driving while intoxicated, the consequences can be severe. You may be expelled from medical school, and charged with a criminal offense.  </p>
<h3>Chicago Drunk Driving Offenses </h3>
<p>Whether you are cruising around University of Chicago’s campus, or coming back from an event at Loyola University, getting behind the driver’s seat after consuming alcoholic beverages can be dangerous and illegal. If a local police officer suspects that you are driving under the influence, he can pull you over, and ask you to take a Breathalyzer or roadside sobriety test. Even when you do not feel intoxicated, your blood alcohol content level may be over the permitted 0.08 percent limit. </p>
<p>A DUI offense is considered a serious crime in Chicago, and upon conviction, you can be subject to harsh penalties, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jail time (up to one year for first offense)</li>
<li>Fines up to $2,500</li>
<li>License suspension</li>
<li>Permanent criminal record</li>
<li>Community service</li>
<li>Alcohol abuse or treatment programs </li>
<li>Significant increase in insurance rates</li>
<li>Civil liabilities (for aggravated DUI offenses that cause injury to someone else)</li>
</ul>
<p>A Chicago drunk driving conviction can completely damage your future medical career and reputation. That’s why, when you are charged, you should consult with an experienced Chicago DUI defense attorney as soon as possible. </p>
<h3>How a Chicago DUI Defense Lawyer Can Help </h3>
<p>Chicago DUI cases can quickly become complicated, especially if your actions injured someone else. Having the right Chicago DUI defense lawyer on your side will be helpful on many levels. A skilled attorney will be able to:</p>
<ul>
