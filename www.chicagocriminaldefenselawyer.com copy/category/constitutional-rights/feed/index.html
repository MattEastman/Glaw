				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you got pulled over and charged with a <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/drug-crimes/"title="Drug Crimes">drug crime</a> in LaSalle or Madison Counties, an upcoming Illinois Supreme Court decision may affect your case. The issue at hand is whether LaSalle County state attorney Brian Towne overstepped his authority when he conceived the State Attorney Felony Enforcement (SAFE) team in 2011, which employed former police officers to conduct patrols, perform traffic stops, and seize the property of suspected traffickers. Madison County implemented a similar program in 2014.</p>
<h3>SAFE Teams Have Confiscated Millions on Illinois Highways</h3>
<p>Ostensibly, the goal of the SAFE units is to aid in the prosecution of <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/drug-crimes/drug-trafficking/"title="Drug Trafficking">drug traffickers</a>. In this respect, they have been very successful, having contributed towards the conviction of 66 individuals. But critics claim that these teams also profited from their law enforcement activities. In 2014 alone, the LaSalle County SAFE team confiscated $900,000 in cash, 14 vehicles, tens of thousands of dollars in gold and silver, and $7.9 million worth of drugs such as marijuana, methamphetamine, and cocaine. </p>
<p>Under the laws of civil asset forfeiture, law enforcement agencies can keep the cash and other valuables that they confiscate from drug crime suspects. They don’t have to return the property even if the suspects prove their innocence in court. Instead, the suspects must challenge the seizure through a different court hearing. Out of 50 seizures that occurred in LaSalle County, less than half resulted in criminal charges, and an even smaller portion resulted in actual convictions. </p>
<p>The SAFE teams had bank accounts to hold the cash obtained from property seizures, and they would share their loot with local police agencies that offered the use of their K9 units. With most of the confiscations not resulting in any criminal charges, it seems that the SAFE units’ practical purpose was not to aid in the prosecution of criminals, but to fill the coffers of the state attorney’s office at the expense of people who were never proven guilty in court. </p>
<h3>Did SAFE Teams Have Authority to Arrest and Seize Assets?</h3>
<p>The state attorney offices of both LaSalle and Madison County claim that the SAFE teams helped keep drugs off the streets. Even if many of the confiscations didn’t result in criminal charges, they argue, the seized money was used to strengthen the state attorney offices’ ability to effectively prosecute other suspects. Whatever the beneficial effect of these seizures, these arguments gloss over important issues.</p>
<p>The appeals court—which took the side of the suspects whose property was seized—stated: &#8220;The prosecution of drug dealers and traffickers is indisputably a duty of the State&#8217;s Attorney; outfitting his own drug interdiction unit is not. Such a statutory construction would effectively give the State&#8217;s Attorney the power to create and maintain the equivalent of his own police force.&#8221; In other words, some judicial authorities have taken the view that the SAFE teams are not legitimate law enforcement agencies. </p>
<p>Further, the Illinois Cannabis Control Act and the Drug Asset Forfeiture Procedure Act both include a section that states: &#8220;While forfeiture may secure for state and local units of government some resources for deterring drug abuse and drug trafficking, forfeiture is not intended to be an alternative means of funding the administration of criminal justice.&#8221; This provision stands in direct contradiction with the activities and structure of the SAFE teams. </p>
<p>Until the Illinois Supreme Court makes a final decision on the legality of the SAFE teams, their activities have been suspended. This means that only members of traditional law enforcement agencies will be making traffic stops on the highways of Illinois, and the prosecutor’s offices won’t be taking money from the very people they are putting behind bars. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People shy away from hiring attorneys for many reasons. Sometimes people worry about the expense while others fear an attorney might escalate the situation, making it more contentious than it needs to be. More than a few people feel they can handle the situation themselves. The problem with all of these reasons and others is that they are often unfounded fears and they fail to take into the consideration the extreme consequences of not hiring a criminal defense attorney. There are many benefits of working with an attorney, culminating in the fact that a lawyer is better equipped to keep you out of jail. If you are facing criminal charges, call Chicago criminal defense lawyer <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/michael-omeara/"title="Learn More About Michael O'Meara">Michael O’Meara</a> for help as soon as possible. </p>
<h3>Top 5 Reasons to Hire a Criminal Defense Lawyer</h3>
<p>There are more reasons to <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/criminal-defense/"title="Chicago Criminal Defense">hire a defense attorney</a> than we can list, but here are the Top 5 reasons for having a lawyer by your side:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Legal Knowledge and experience</strong>:
<p>Individuals without any legal training or experience can go through the criminal court process alone, but they will be trying to figure out what to do every step of the way. Prosecutors will always be steps ahead and have the advantage. Instead of trying to learn what you should or need to do while facing a criminal offense, get help from someone who has years of legal training and experience.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Analysis of your case</strong>:
<p> Your attorney will speak with you, review the prosecutor’s evidence, and investigate your situation in order to thoroughly analyze your case compared to the law. An experienced criminal defense attorney can give you an honest review of your situation, including your worst and best case scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Seek to have your case dismissed or charges reduced</strong>:
<p> A criminal defense attorney will always look to see if there is any legal basis for having your case dismissed entirely or the charges reduced. You may think there is a strong case against you and your situation is hopeless. A defense attorney will be able to see if that’s true or not.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Have certain evidence excluded or included</strong>:
<p> In some cases, prosecutors will have evidence that should be excluded from the case for various reasons. It may have been obtained illegally or by hearsay. A lawyer will motion to have this type of evidence excluded so that it can’t hurt you in court. On the other hand, you lawyer will also work to have evidence that supports your case.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Fight for reduced penalties</strong>:
<p>Whether it is through a negotiated plea bargain or during sentencing after a guilty verdict, an experienced criminal defense attorney understands how to argue to the minimum consequences of a conviction. This may include seeking little to no jail through the use of probation or community service.</p>
</ol>
</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you know your rights if you are pulled over by the police? If you do, you’re one of a few. Many people aren’t sure of how they should behave when the police pull them over. What instructions are they required to follow and what requests can they deny? This lack of certainty leads many people to not uphold their constitutional rights, which can be detrimental to them in a future court case for a traffic or criminal offense. That is why Illinois will now require driver’s education classes to address a person’s rights during Illinois traffic stops. But if you did not receive this type of education in school or from family, you may have been in a <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/traffic-violations/"title="Traffic Violations">traffic stop</a> without understanding what you could and could not do or say.</p>
<p>If you are facing the consequences of a traffic stop, call the experienced Chicago criminal defense attorneys at <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/"title="Chicago Criminal Defense Lawyer">O’Meara Law</a> at <strong><span class="ibp"> </span></strong>.</p>
<h3>New Driver’s Education Training Coming Soon</h3>
<p>Gov. Bruce Rauner signed bill HB6131 into law in the beginning of August. The new curriculum requirement goes into effect during the 2017-18 school year or after June 30, 2017, for private driving schools. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocTypeID=HB&#038;DocNum=6131&#038;GAID=13&#038;SessionID=88&#038;LegID=95665" target="_blank">synopsis of the bill</a> states that driving course should include instruction on law enforcement procedures during traffic stops, “including a demonstration of the proper actions to be taken during a traffic stop and appropriate interactions with law enforcement.” The Illinois Secretary of State will develop the guidelines for this requirement.  </p>
<p>Many believe this law is timely because of news coverage revolving around traffic stops that have escalated leading to a drivers&#8217; injury or death. Legislators believe that if a driver understands how to behave when stopped by the police, there will be no need for the situation to turn dangerous or deadly for anyone. </p>
<h3>Your Rights During A Traffic Stop</h3>
<p>People who are unaware of their rights at a traffic stop can escalate a simple situation into an argument with the police. Here are some of your key rights when you are involved in a traffic stop:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You must identify yourself</strong>: The police will first ask for your license and probably your car insurance. You need to give them your name, license, and insurance card.</li>
<li><strong>You do not have to answer other questions</strong>: The police generally ask you a few questions like where you are coming from or going to, or do you know how fast you were driving. You don’t have to answer. It may be best to calmly state that you will not answer any questions without an attorney present.</li>
<li><strong>You must get out of the car</strong>: If the police suspect you of <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/dui/"title="Chicago DUI Lawyer">drinking and driving</a> or another crime, they may ask you to get out of the car. You are legally required to comply. Follow the police officer’s instructions calmly. </li>
<li><strong>You do not have to take a field sobriety test</strong>: Field sobriety tests are not mandatory and you can calmly tell the police officer that you will not submit to such the test. </li>
<li><strong>Refusing a breath test can result in a penalty</strong>: Under Illinois law, you impliedly consent to a breath test. If you refuse, you can lose your license for a period time under an administrative revocation.</li>
<li><strong>You do not have to consent to a search of your car</strong>: Sometimes police will ask if they can look in your car. You should tell them no. If the police had probable cause to search your vehicle, they would not ask you, they would simply do it. If they ask for permission, they do not have probable cause, and you do not have to let them look in your car. </li>
<li><strong>You may ask if you are free to go</strong>: If the traffic stop seems to be taking a long time, you may always ask “Officer, am I being detained or am I free to go?” </li>
<li><strong>You must sign the ticket</strong>: If you are given a ticket, accept it calmly and sign it when instructed to do so. Signing the ticket is not an admission of guilt. Refusing to sign the ticket can lead to your arrest.</ul>
</li>
<p>Remember that no matter what happens or what the police ask you, you should remain calm. Do not argue or swear. Your attitude can greatly affect the situation. </p>
<h3>Call a Lawyer Right Away</h3>
<p>If you are arrested or ticketed during a traffic stop, call the Chicago criminal defense attorneys at O’Meara Law right away. You have the right to an attorney at all times after you arrest. Simply say “I refuse to answer questions until I have an attorney present.” You cannot be punished for this and it is not an admission of guilty. </p>
<p>Call O’Meara Law at <strong><span class="ibp"> </span></strong> or use the online chat to schedule a consultation. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve ever had the misfortune of dealing with a DUI arrest, it may seem that in the blink of an eye you went from driving home to being handcuffed and put in the back of a police car.  When you are left to reflect in the back seat of a patrol car, you are probably wondering how your night went so wrong.</p>
<p>Illinois law enforcement takes <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/dui/"title="Chicago DUI">DUI charges</a> very seriously and would rather arrest anyone they suspect to be driving while impaired than let someone be a threat to public safety. But this vigorous enforcement of DUI law means that people like you can be arrested when they aren’t committing a crime. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s up to you to get through this DUI arrest and protect your own rights. If you were arrested for a DUI, don’t hesitate to call the Chicago DUI defense attorneys of <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/"title="Chicago Criminal Defense Lawyer">O’Meara Law</a> at <strong><span class="ibp"> </span></strong>. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Get an attorney immediately</strong>. After you are arrested and taken to the police station, you will be given the opportunity to contact someone regarding your arrest. The truth is that this may take some time and it isn’t just one phone call. You can have a reasonable number of calls to get ahold of someone. Call your attorney directly or speak with a family member who can call an attorney. A lawyer will guide you through questioning and ensure you are released from jail as soon as possible. </p>
<li>
<p><strong>Stay silent and ask for a lawyer</strong>. Everyone’s heard of their right to remain silent but many people don’t use it. Some people think cooperating means answering the police officers’ questions, even if they end up admitting to having a drink or two earlier in the day. Just remember: the police can use anything you say against you later in court. It is always safer to clearly refuse to answer any questions until your attorney is present. Don’t say you think you want an attorney or that you might need an attorney. State “I will not answer any questions until I have my attorney present.” Once you ask for an attorney, all police questioning must stop until you have your lawyer in the room with you. The police can’t use your silence against you.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not argue</strong>. People become confrontational after an arrest for a number of reasons. You’re nervous and scared or even outraged when you’ve been arrested for a crime you didn’t commit. But the police station is not the time to argue your case – you and your attorney will have the opportunity to do that later in court with the prosecutor. Disagreeing with the police, even if you believe you’re being polite, can result in the police using what you say against you and treating you as a threat to their safety.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Refuse a warrantless blood test</strong>. When you are arrested for a DUI, the police may ask you to take a <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/dui/dui-testing/"title="DUI Testing">blood test</a>. This can give them a more accurate reading of your BAC at the time of the arrest. You are not required to submit to this test. The police must obtain a valid warrant for this test before they can require you to take it. A valid warrant will have a description of what is required and a judge or magistrate’s signature.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You will be released on bail</strong>. You will be released on a bail bond, which is an amount of money that is refunded – minus fees – when you return for your trial. The amount of your bail will be set by the judge who will consider the circumstances of the DUI and your financial ability. You, a family member, or a friend must pay 10 percent of the bail amount to secure your release – your attorney can’t pay it for you. You will only have to pay the remaining 90 percent if you fail to appear in court or violate a condition of the bond.</ol>
</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Headed by Senator Dick Durbin, Illinois is shaping out to be a leader in criminal justice reforms. Senator Durbin is pushing legislation that will automatically reduce the minimum sentence of non-violent crimes. This reform will also aid in reducing relapses in criminal behavior and strengthen the prison programming. </p>
<p>However, in order for this legislation to go into effect, it would need support from both sides of the aisle. Republican United States Senator Mark Kirk recently announced that he would co-sponsor new legislation to reduce the minimum sentence of non-violent crimes. Kirk’s sponsorship could be instrumental in getting this bill off the ground floor. </p>
<h3>Illinois Committed to Criminal Justice Reform</h3>
<p>Bruce Rauner, Illinois Governor publicly announced a challenge to lower the Illinois prison population by at least 25% within the next ten years. In keeping with this challenge, he formulated the <a href="http://www.icjia.org/cjreform2015/" title="State Commission on Criminal Justice and Sentencing Reform" target="_blank">State Commission on Criminal Justice and Sentencing Reform</a>. This committee is comprised of criminal justice practitioners, including policymakers as well as lawmakers. </p>
<p>This Commission’s objective is to lead the reform movement in the state by evaluating sentencing structures, policies, and developing recommendations to help accomplish criminal reform legislation.  The committee has already released one round of recommendation and will release additional rounds in the next few months. </p>
<p>State Senator Kwame Raoul, who sits on the Committee on Restorative Justice has personally pledged to push these reform initiatives. Supporters of this criminal justice reform in Illinois strongly believe that the state places too much reliance on the prison system, placing many communities in Illinois at a disadvantage while doing nothing to rehabilitate offenders. </p>
<h3>Public Support for the Reforms</h3>
<p>The U.S Justice Action Network recently administered a public poll to assess the support the justice reform. The poll revealed that there was overwhelming support from Illinois citizens, both from Republican and Democratic voters. More than ninety percent of Republicans and ninety-two percent of Democrats were in support of decreasing prison time for offenders who had committed crimes that were low risk and not violent in nature. </p>
<p>On the other hand, as many as eighty-seven percent of Illinois voters favored replacing minimum sentencing requirements with ranges that would be left up to the discretion of the judge and determined based on the circumstances of each case and offender. Last year, taxpayers in Illinois spent more than 1 billion dollars on incarceration and has yet to see a return on their investment in regards to public safety. </p>
<p>Lower sentences only address half the battle of rehabilitating offenders. The majority of Illinois voters recognized this fact because 94% believed that the criminal justice system should offer more support to offenders who were reentering society.  Voters felt that the government would do well to provide more job training and opportunities which would help ex-offenders acquire jobs, enabling them to support their families, and even more importantly prevent them from turning back to criminal behavior. </p>
<h3>Facing Criminal Charges in Illinois? Call Attorney Michael O&#8217;Meara Today</h3>
<p>With mass public support, criminal justice reform should be forthcoming. However, Illinois residents will have to wait on their legislature to take the necessary steps to bring such reforms to reality.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Forensic evidence is critical to the criminal judicial system in Chicago, Illinois. In fact, it is the basis of many acquittals and the driving force behind a number of convictions. Since forensic evidence is governed by scientific procedures, it is often felt that it is the closest a court will come to getting to the truth. </p>
<p>It is, therefore, shocking to many, when there are revelations of forensic failure in criminal cases. It becomes even more troubling that legislators would propose laws that would seek to hide those failures than to ensure that such failures are rectified and never happen. However, the Illinois general assembly is going with the former option with the passing of a law that could result in a major cover-up of the mistakes of the forensic police crime lab.</p>
<h3>Why Should We Be Concerned?</h3>
<p>About nine months ago an investigatory team of a major news network unearthed a series of forensic failures in the state operated police crime lab. The results of those investigations became public and individuals were shocked to learn of serious breaches that could very well have jeopardized a number of criminal cases.</p>
<p>So what was the response of the legislature? Instead of seeking to close the gaping holes and allow for better systems of accountability and procedure, the legislature proposed laws that will give the police the autonomy to develop their own rules about how and what forensic information to share. The effects are far reaching.</p>
<p>In every criminal matter, a defendant is innocent until proven guilty. Even where there is unequivocal forensic evidence, it must be presented and vigorously challenged. The defendant has the right to the discovery of this evidence and criminal defense attorney’s make regular request to the state police crime lab for such information. If the police are allowed to make the rules surrounding what information can be shared with the public, then the essential pillow of evidence discovery in the criminal justice system will be undermined.</p>
<h3>What Would the Police Be Hiding?</h3>
<p>It is unfortunate that we live in a society where trust and confidence in law enforcement personnel are dwindling. Especially in Chicago, where there has been numerous public outrage in relation to police misconduct, the public don’t believe that the police can protect them from the criminal elements and defendants feel like there is no justice. This new legislation which is now up for signature from the Governor does nothing to help a city or state that desires disclosure over secrecy.</p>
<p>Some of the forensic failures discovered only nine months ago included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switching of test samples;</li>
<li>Non-matching names;</li>
<li>Viral of evidence that was run incorrectly;</li>
<li>General inaccuracies; and</li>
<li>Faulty methods of destroying evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Opponents of this legislation and many in the criminal defense practice believe that this is an attempt by the legislators to give the police the opportunity to cover up such failures in the future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Historically as a nation, we have moved away from many practices that seek to discriminate an individual on unjustifiable grounds, a hate crime is still a big concern in the country and in particular Illinois. A hate crime involves the physical harm to a person and property that is motived by the victim’s race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or other similar factors.</p>
<p>To keep track of such crimes, law enforcement agencies are required to make annual reports about hate crimes committed in their community. However, recent reports reveal that more the 20% of agencies in Illinois have failed to make this report. This has resulted in some concern as to whether the lack of reporting is indicative of the absence of such crimes or just plain lack of compliance.</p>
<h3>Why The Lack of Reporting by Law Enforcement</h3>
<p>Law enforcement agencies for all states are required to submit an annual report to the FBI in relation to all hate crimes committed in their community. For the years, 2009 to 2014, the state of Illinois had 20% non-compliance. This statistic is in keeping with the nationwide non-compliance of 17%. But why?</p>
<p>In many instances, the agencies who have failed to make the necessary reports blamed human resource issues. Police departments with limited manpower just did not have enough time to prepare the report. With the priority on fighting and preventing crime, completing a report seem to be an administrative task that just got left behind.</p>
<p>In other police departments, officials site ignorance of the requirement to report such crimes to the FBI and others indicated that they did not file a report because there was none. Nevertheless, the requirement to report includes documenting that no such crimes occurred in that year. </p>
<p>Hate crime advocates are particularly concerned about this discovery since their message has always been that such crimes get swept under the rug and are often not counted as hate crimes. However, since the reporting was voluntary, there is no action that can be taken in relation to those agencies who have failed to report over the years. But that will change soon.</p>
<h3>New Law to Mandate Compliance with Hate Crime Reporting</h3>
<p>Despite the fact that Illinois compliance is better than a number of other states, there is a need to ensure that non-compliance with the requirement to report hate crimes is at a minimal or none at all. To do so, the state will be putting into law legislation that will force agencies to make the necessary report to the FBI. Failure to comply will result in the loss of critical<br />
funding for such law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>The new law will take effect in January 2017. Illinois will join other states that implement financial penalties for failure to carry out the necessary reporting of hate crime.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To be arrested for a crime can be a very overwhelming situation. It often times leaves individuals confused, especially if they know that they are innocent. Chicago has been in the news over the years for allegations of police abuse of power. To add to the fire are startling facts that reveal that less than 0.5% of individuals who are arrested actually get to see an attorney following their arrest.</p>
<p>This information was revealed by CNN following a request from the Chicago Police Department. It is on the heels of a report from a task force established by the Chicago Mayor to investigate the police practices. The results of that report indicated that persons arrested were only able to make phone calls after processing and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Is This a Breach of Constitutional Rights?</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/criminal-defense/">right to an attorney</a> is a right afforded to all individuals who are charged. It is a constitutional right that is an integral part of the Miranda Rights that is repeated to persons who are being arrested. In response to the statistics, the Chicago police department maintains that each detainee is read his or her rights and that many are released after processing without any questioning.</p>
<p>The task force report and the CNN story is cause for much concern, especially in a city where murder rates are high and there are ever growing outraged about racial profiling and brutality by the police force. The Chicago Police department states that there were no breaches of constitutional rights and that many persons opt not to call a lawyer so as not to prolong their processing. But with more than 99% of arrestees not having access to even free legal aid, the Chicago Police is coming under more fire.</p>
<h3>What Should You Do if You&#8217;re Arrested</h3>
<p>Knowing your rights is critical to every criminal case. Being able to stand firm in those rights can make a significant difference. Here are some useful tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not resist arrest</strong> – This is can lead to further charges and may aggravate an otherwise calm situation. If you feel that you are being arrested as a result of racial profiling or without probable cause, verbally express your concerns, but do not seek to assault the police officer. Remember if the police officer is going to arrest you, he or she will proceed, so physical resistance will not help.</li>
<li><strong>Remain silent</strong> – Once arrested whatever you say can be used against you. It is, therefore, important that you only provide information that is necessary to your processing. You should decline to answer questions by remaining silent or asking for an attorney.</li>
<li><strong>Ask for an attorney</strong> – You have a right to an attorney and you should indicate that at the earliest possible opportunity. Many innocent individuals get into further trouble by answering what seem like innocent questions without a Chicago criminal defense attorney present.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always remember that the police have a job to do and their objective is generally different from yours. You should always secure your rights by making sure you have a lawyer present after your arrest. </p>
