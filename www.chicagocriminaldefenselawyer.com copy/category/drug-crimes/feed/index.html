				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On July 29, 2016, Illinois became the 17th state in the nation to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana. Senate Bill 2228, which went into effect immediately, makes it a civil offense—like a traffic ticket—to possess any amount of marijuana under 10 grams. There is no possibility of jail time for this offense, and the fines range from $100 to $200.</p>
<h3>Illinois Lawmakers Reform the State’s Approach to Marijuana Policy</h3>
<p>The new law comes after several Illinois cities and municipalities decriminalized marijuana, starting with Chicago in 2012. <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/billstatus.asp?DocNum=2228&#038;GAID=13&#038;GA=99&#038;DocTypeID=SB&#038;LegID=93232&#038;SessionID=88" target="_blank">Senate Bill 2228</a> will not override older municipal ordinances that decriminalize marijuana, so the fines for possessing marijuana may be different in different parts of the state. </p>
<p>Senate Bill 2228 does more than decriminalize marijuana—it puts in place several reforms that will lessen the burdens on the state’s marijuana users. For one, a conviction for the civil offense of marijuana possession automatically gets expunged after 6 months. This means that the drug offense will be invisible to potential employers who perform background checks.</p>
<p>These reforms aren’t just good for marijuana users—they’re good for the finances of the state of Illinois. According to an Illinois Sentencing Policy Advisory Council financial impact analysis, Senate Bill 2228 will save the state an estimated $24 million over three years from the reduced cost of incarcerating marijuana offenders and the increased revenue from the fines.</p>
<p>The new policy is in line with Governor Rauner’s plan to reduce Illinois’s prison population by a quarter over the next ten years. Under the old legal framework, the possession of 10 grams of marijuana was punishable by up to 6 months in jail. That meant that the state would have to spend money on housing and feeding marijuana offenders in detention instead of just collecting a fine. </p>
<h3>Illinois is No Longer a Zero Tolerance State for DUI Cases Involving Marijuana</h3>
<p>The new law also changes the state’s approach to <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/dui/driving-under-influence-of-drugs/" title="Driving Under the Influence of Drugs">DUI cases involving marijuana impairment</a>. Previously a “zero tolerance” state on weed and driving, Illinois will now allow people to drive a vehicle so long as their blood concentration of THC does not exceed 5 nanograms. Illinois drivers no longer need to fear a DUI charge for smoking a joint a week before getting pulled over. </p>
<p>There is no scientific consensus on what blood concentration of THC correlates with impairment, so the new THC limit is arbitrary. Nonetheless, the small margin of safety is welcome news to marijuana users—especially medical marijuana patients who may need to medicate daily to treat their illness. </p>
<p>While Senate Bill 2228 is a step in one direction, marijuana users in Illinois may still face criminal charges. When a blood test show’s that a driver’s THC level is over the limit, he or she will face <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/dui/" title="Chicago DUI Lawyer">DUI charges</a>. Individuals who get caught with less than 10 grams of marijuana along with a scale or baggies may still get charged with drug dealing.</p>
<p>In such cases, you can count on the dedication of O’Meara Law LLC. Our goal is to give each and every one of our clients the best prospects possible as they face the Illinois criminal justice system.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, you can be charged with a DUI even if a breath test shows a blood alcohol content (BAC) level under .08 percent. Many people believe that the only way to be arrested for a DUI is to have been drinking alcohol and blow a .08 percent or higher on a breathalyzer. However, there’s much more to a DUI than your BAC. If you were charged with a DUI despite blowing less than a .08 percent, call a <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/dui/" title="DUI Defense">Chicago DUI defense lawyer</a> with O’Meara Law at <strong><span class="ibp"> </span></strong>. </p>
<h3>Illinois DUI Law</h3>
<p>People may concentrate on the 0.08 BAC standard, but the truth is that the law describes a variety of actions that can lead to a DUI conviction. Illinois law <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs4.asp?DocName=062500050HCh%2E+11+Art%2E+V&#038;ActID=1815&#038;ChapterID=49&#038;SeqStart=116700000&#038;SeqEnd=118800000" title="625 ILCS 5/11-501" target="_blank">625 ILCS 5/11-501</a> states a person should not drive or be in control of any vehicle if he or she:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has a BAC of .08 percent or more</li>
<li>Is under the influence of alcohol</li>
<li>Is under the influence of an intoxicating compound or combination of intoxicating compounds to a degree that renders a person incapable of driving safely</li>
<li>Is under the influence of any other drug or combination of drugs to a degree that renders a person incapable of driving safely</li>
<li>Is under the combined influence of alcohol, drugs, or intoxicating compounds</li>
<li>Has any amount of drug, substance, or compound on their breath, blood, or urine resulting from the unlawful consumption of a controlled substance like cannabis or methamphetamine</li>
</ul>
<h3>Marijuana Can Lead to a DUI</h3>
<p>If you consumer marijuana, your perception and physical abilities may be altered. This could lead to a DUI. If an officer sees or smells marijuana in your vehicle, he or she automatically has probable cause to believe you’ve consumed it illegally. Even if there are no other signs of impairment, that’s enough to arrest you for a DUI.  </p>
<p>If you lawfully used marijuana for a medical reason, you can still be convicted of a DUI if the cannabis impaired your abilities to drive safely. If you were arrested for marijuana use but you were not impaired, you will need to work with an experienced Chicago DUI defense lawyer to prove your innocence. Your attorney will strive to show the prosecutor that you did not pose a danger on the road. </p>
<h3>Medications Can Cause a DUI</h3>
<p>Many people consume drugs other than alcohol and marijuana. Some of these drugs are illegal, controlled substances, but many times they are prescribed or over-the-counter medications. There are a great deal of medications that can alter a person’s abilities. Opioid painkillers are commonly prescribed for people who suffer from acute or long-term pain, but can be unsafe to drive depending on the individual’s reaction. Popular medications like Benadryl for allergies can make people incredibly drowsy. </p>
<p>It is possible to be arrested for a DUI because of the effects of completely legal drugs. The basis of the charge is not necessary the medication you took, but the effect that medication had on your physical and mental capabilities. </p>
<h3>Contact a Chicago DUI Defense Lawyer</h3>
<p>Facing a DUI based on any reason is a challenge, but it’s particularly scary when you feel like you did nothing wrong. Attorney Michael O’Meara understands that charges can arise from simple mistakes, which is why he will fight tenaciously for your rights in court. As a former prosecutor, Michael O’Meara understands the nuances of DUI charges and offenses. He knows how to work to have your charges dropped or get the best results possible for the situation.</p>

		<title>Illinois Senate Moves to Decriminalize Possession of Marijuana Less than 10 Grams</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent years, there has been a wave of legislative changes in relation to offenses connecting to the <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/drug-crimes/marijuana/">possession and use of marijuana</a>. As more research validates the drugs recreational and medical benefits, more states are moving to institute laws that would decriminalize certain activities surrounded the drug.</p>
<p>On April 19, 2016, the Illinois Senate voted in favor of a proposal to decriminalize the possession of marijuana in a quantity that would amount to less than 10 grams. If made into law, the bill is designed to prevent individuals found guilty of possession of small quantities of the drug from having a criminal record.</p>
<h3>What Does the Proposed Law Change</h3>
<p>Currently, if you are found in possession of marijuana, you can face jail time or fines, or a combination of both. Additionally, the possession of marijuana up to 10 grams is considered a misdemeanor under Illinois state law and penalties can range from 30 days to six months behind bars and a maximum fine of $1,500. As a misdemeanor, the conviction will form part of the offender’s criminal record leading to lifelong consequences in getting a job or seeking further education.</p>
<p>The new measure, titled Senate Bill 2228, would remove the jail time penalties associated with the offense. The net result is to eliminate the criminal classification of the offense. In fact, possession of marijuana for quantities up to 10 grams under the proposed legislation would be classified as a civil violation resulting in a citation and fine. Once the fine is paid, the proposed law allows for the record to be expunged in the near future.</p>
<h3>Why Is This Proposal Different?</h3>
<p>This move by the Illinois Senate is not new to the state or even the country. There are more than 100 communities in Illinois that have already made the move to remove criminal penalties associated with possession of marijuana in small quantities. Similar laws are currently in force in some 20 other states.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind the move is that possession of the drug in small quantities is not viewed as a serious offense. It is felt that such individuals are mere consumers of the drugs and should not face criminal punishment that will significantly affect their employment and educational prospects.</p>
<h3>How an Illinois Marijuana Lawyer Can Help You</h3>
<p>While the proposed Bill received an overwhelming support in the senate, it is still not law. It is now back in the House where It will up for further consideration. Accordingly, the current law stands and if you are found guilty of possession of marijuana up to 10 grams you could face criminal penalties depending on the town in which that you are charged.</p>
<p>At O’Meara Law, your case is in good hands. With over 20 years of experience in criminal defense litigation, Michael O&#8217;Meara is passionate about providing high-quality legal representation to individual charged with an Illinois offense, inclusive of possession of marijuana.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few things are as stressful as getting charged with a crime. From the humiliation of getting arrested, to the inconvenience of court appearances, to the prospect of jail time and fines, facing the <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/criminal-defense/">criminal justice system</a> can turn your life upside down. If you get convicted of a crime, you will get a permanent entry on your criminal record that can keep you from getting a job, owning a firearm, or going to school. </p>
<p>Fortunately, a skilled Chicago criminal defense attorney working at your side can help you avoid the harshest consequences of a criminal conviction. He or she may be able to obtain the dismissal of your charges, a victory at trial, or a deal with the prosecutor for a conviction of a lesser crime. And even if you do get a conviction, your crime may qualify for the expungement or sealing of your criminal record.</p>
<h3>Don’t Give Up Hope If You’ve Been Charged With a Crime</h3>
<p>Your lawyer may be able to have the charges against you dismissed, which means that you “win” your case even before it goes to trial. The prosecutor must have enough evidence in his or her case to make it worth the state’s time and money to put you on trial. If your lawyer can convince the judge that there isn’t enough evidence against you, your charges may get dismissed. </p>
<p>One strategy for obtaining the dismissal of your charges is filing a motion to suppress the prosecution’s evidence. If the motion to suppress is successful, the judge will order that some pieces of the prosecution’s evidence be removed from the case. When this happens, the prosecutor is often left without enough evidence to make a case against you. This leaves your lawyer in a position to request the dismissal of your charges.</p>
<h3>Your Lawyer Can Challenge the Prosecutor’s Evidence Against You</h3>
<p>Filing a motion to suppress the prosecution’s evidence may be an option in your case in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The police failed to respect your Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. For example, they searched your house without a warrant or pulled your car over without reasonable suspicion you were committing a crime.</li>
<li>The police denied your Fifth Amendment right to remain silent by failing to inform you that your words could and would be used against you.</li>
<li>You clearly requested that you wanted a lawyer but the police continued to interrogate you and obtained incriminating statements—which violates your Sixth Amendment Rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>If successful, the motion to suppress will result in the removal of any evidence obtained because of the authorities’ illegal conduct.</p>
<h3>You Can Beat the Prosecution’s Charges at Trial</h3>
<p>The prosecution must prove every element of its case beyond a reasonable doubt. This means that if you’ve been charged with drug possession, for example, the prosecution must present evidence that is so convincing that no reasonable person could doubt that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You had a controlled substance in your possession or under your control</li>
<li>You knew that the substance was illegal</li>
<li>The substance was actually illegal</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a difficult burden to meet. If your lawyer can show that there is some doubt as to even one of these elements, the jury will be instructed to enter a verdict of not guilty. For example, if your lawyer presents evidence that the equipment used to test the drugs was deficient, or that the crime lab has a history of not following procedures, there may be a reasonable doubt as to whether the substance in your possession was an illegal drug. </p>
<h3>A Good Lawyer Can Get You on the Jury’s Good Side</h3>
<p>Juries do not always follow the judge’s instructions. If the defense has proved there is a reasonable doubt as to an element of the prosecution’s case, the jury still has the ability to enter a verdict of guilty—in defiance of the judge’s instructions. In fact, some legal professionals believe that most juries utterly disregard their instructions and come to their conclusions based on their gut feeling—or prejudices. </p>
<p>Conversely, juries may be persuaded to enter a verdict of not-guilty even when the evidence overwhelmingly points towards your guilt. One of the most famous examples of a jury’s ability to derail the prosecution is the trial of OJ Simpson, who received a verdict of not guilty from a jury that deeply sympathized with him—despite the fact that he almost certainly was guilty. </p>
<p>A lawyer’s ability to portray you as a good person fighting an unfair criminal justice system can have a strong effect on the jury. Your attorney’s charisma and ability to tell a story is often just as important as his or her knowledge of the law. Attorney Michael S. O’Meara has both the experience and trial advocacy skills to get you excellent results when facing criminal charges. </p>
<h3>How a Chicago Criminal Defense Attorney Can Help You</h3>
<p>Although you don’t need a lawyer to obtain the sealing or expungement of your criminal records, your chances of success will be greater if you hire one to file the petition on your behalf. To learn more about expungement, record sealing, or how to defend against your criminal charges, call Chicago criminal defense lawyer Mike O’Meara today at <strong><span class="ibp"> </span></strong> for a free and confidential consultation of your case. </p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve been pulled over and charged with a drug crime, you should hire a skilled Chicago criminal defense attorney immediately. Do not talk to the police before consulting with your lawyer and do not accept a guilty plea, no matter how attractive it may seem. If the police pulled you over, conducted a search, and then arrested you, there is a good chance your lawyer can fight the charges if you act quickly.</p>
<p>Every person on American soil benefits from the protection of the US Constitution—regardless of his or her citizenship. These rights apply from the moment police initiate contact to the final stages of the criminal trial. This article will describe the rights of a drug crime suspect at various stages of a traffic stop, and explain how a skilled lawyer can defend your drug crime case. </p>
<h3>Challenging the Basis for the Traffic Stop</h3>
<p>The police cannot arbitrarily stop drivers. They must act on “reasonable suspicion” that the driver has committed a crime. This means that the police cannot pull you over on the mere hunch that you’ve done something illegal. Instead, they must have reason to believe you’ve committed a crime or a traffic violation such as driving with an expired tag or broken taillight.</p>
<p>It is actually quite difficult for the police to justify pulling you over on the suspicion that you are committing a drug crime, unless they had a tip from an informant or saw you doing drugs before or while you were driving. If the officer suspected you of being intoxicated based on your driving, your lawyer can make the case that your erratic or abnormal driving had an innocent explanation such as drowsiness or a mechanical issue with your vehicle.</p>
<p>If there was no reasonable suspicion justifying the initial <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/traffic-violations/">traffic stop</a> that led to your arrest, your lawyer may be able to have your drug charges dismissed—even if the police searched your vehicle and found drugs. This is because the prosecutor’s office cannot use evidence obtained from an illegal traffic stop in its case against you.</p>
<h3>Claiming that the Search of your Vehicle or Person Was Unreasonable</h3>
<p>Assuming the officer who pulled you over had a reasonable suspicion to do so, you may still be able to avoid a conviction for your drug crime charges. When the police are conducting a traffic search based on reasonable suspicion, they can only detain a suspect for the amount of time necessary to confirm or deny their suspicions that a crime is being committed. </p>
<p>For example, if you were speeding, the officer should have let you go after giving you a ticket or a warning—unless the officer gained probable cause that you were committing an additional crime. Probable cause is a slightly higher standard than the reasonable suspicion standard the officer needed to justify pulling you over. This means that the prosecutor will have a tougher time convincing the jury that the police had good reason to suspect you of criminal behavior at this stage of the encounter, after the initial traffic stop.  </p>
<p>If you say or do things that give the officer probable cause to believe that you’re high or in possession of drugs, the officer may detain you longer and investigate his or her suspicions by searching you or your vehicle. This is why you should always (calmly and politely) exercise your 5th amendment right to remain silent during a police encounter. Anything you say—or even the way in which you say it—could give the officer reason to believe you are high or in possession of drugs. </p>
<p>The police will also be justified in searching your vehicle if they see illegal items in plain sight, such as a weed pipe or a bag of drugs on your car seat. The odor of <a jref="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/drug-crimes/marijuana/">marijuana</a> has also been ruled to be a sufficient source of probable cause to search a vehicle during an Illinois traffic stop. Finally, the police can search your vehicle if a drug dog marks your vehicle. The police do not need probable cause to use a drug dog on your car, but they cannot make you wait an unreasonable amount of time for the drug dog to arrive.</p>
<h3>Obtaining the Dismissal of your Drug Crime Charges</h3>
<p>To summarize, a traffic stop can result in legitimate <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/drug-crimes/marijuana/">drug crime charges</a> when the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>The initial traffic stop was based on the reasonable suspicion that you were committing a crime (whether related to drugs or not)</li>
<li>The officer gained reasonable cause to believe you were committing a drug crime over the course of the traffic stop because: you said something incriminating; the officer smelled drugs; the officer saw drugs in plain sight; OR a drug dog marked your car</li>
<li>The officer searched you or your vehicle and obtained incriminating evidence based on a source of probable cause enumerated above, or because you consented to the search </li>
<li>The officer who arrested you explained that you have a right to an attorney and to remain silent, and that any statement you make can be used against you</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the circumstances under which a police officer can legally pull a suspect over, search for drugs, and gain the basis for making an arrest are fairly narrow. This means that if your charges resulted from a similar scenario, you should consult with an experienced attorney who may be able to have the charges dismissed even before your trial starts. </p>
<p>Your lawyer may be able to have the evidence against you removed from the prosecution’s case by filing a motion to suppress. The motion to suppress will likely be successful when the prosecutor’s evidence was obtained in violation of your constitutional right to be free form unreasonable searches and seizures. Sometimes, a successful motion to suppress will leave the prosecutor with so little admissible evidence against you that your lawyer can then file for a motion to dismiss the charges. </p>
