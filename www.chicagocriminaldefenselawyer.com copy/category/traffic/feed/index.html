				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you know your rights if you are pulled over by the police? If you do, you’re one of a few. Many people aren’t sure of how they should behave when the police pull them over. What instructions are they required to follow and what requests can they deny? This lack of certainty leads many people to not uphold their constitutional rights, which can be detrimental to them in a future court case for a traffic or criminal offense. That is why Illinois will now require driver’s education classes to address a person’s rights during Illinois traffic stops. But if you did not receive this type of education in school or from family, you may have been in a <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/traffic-violations/"title="Traffic Violations">traffic stop</a> without understanding what you could and could not do or say.</p>
<p>If you are facing the consequences of a traffic stop, call the experienced Chicago criminal defense attorneys at <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/"title="Chicago Criminal Defense Lawyer">O’Meara Law</a> at <strong><span class="ibp"> </span></strong>.</p>
<h3>New Driver’s Education Training Coming Soon</h3>
<p>Gov. Bruce Rauner signed bill HB6131 into law in the beginning of August. The new curriculum requirement goes into effect during the 2017-18 school year or after June 30, 2017, for private driving schools. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocTypeID=HB&#038;DocNum=6131&#038;GAID=13&#038;SessionID=88&#038;LegID=95665" target="_blank">synopsis of the bill</a> states that driving course should include instruction on law enforcement procedures during traffic stops, “including a demonstration of the proper actions to be taken during a traffic stop and appropriate interactions with law enforcement.” The Illinois Secretary of State will develop the guidelines for this requirement.  </p>
<p>Many believe this law is timely because of news coverage revolving around traffic stops that have escalated leading to a drivers&#8217; injury or death. Legislators believe that if a driver understands how to behave when stopped by the police, there will be no need for the situation to turn dangerous or deadly for anyone. </p>
<h3>Your Rights During A Traffic Stop</h3>
<p>People who are unaware of their rights at a traffic stop can escalate a simple situation into an argument with the police. Here are some of your key rights when you are involved in a traffic stop:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You must identify yourself</strong>: The police will first ask for your license and probably your car insurance. You need to give them your name, license, and insurance card.</li>
<li><strong>You do not have to answer other questions</strong>: The police generally ask you a few questions like where you are coming from or going to, or do you know how fast you were driving. You don’t have to answer. It may be best to calmly state that you will not answer any questions without an attorney present.</li>
<li><strong>You must get out of the car</strong>: If the police suspect you of <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/dui/"title="Chicago DUI Lawyer">drinking and driving</a> or another crime, they may ask you to get out of the car. You are legally required to comply. Follow the police officer’s instructions calmly. </li>
<li><strong>You do not have to take a field sobriety test</strong>: Field sobriety tests are not mandatory and you can calmly tell the police officer that you will not submit to such the test. </li>
<li><strong>Refusing a breath test can result in a penalty</strong>: Under Illinois law, you impliedly consent to a breath test. If you refuse, you can lose your license for a period time under an administrative revocation.</li>
<li><strong>You do not have to consent to a search of your car</strong>: Sometimes police will ask if they can look in your car. You should tell them no. If the police had probable cause to search your vehicle, they would not ask you, they would simply do it. If they ask for permission, they do not have probable cause, and you do not have to let them look in your car. </li>
<li><strong>You may ask if you are free to go</strong>: If the traffic stop seems to be taking a long time, you may always ask “Officer, am I being detained or am I free to go?” </li>
<li><strong>You must sign the ticket</strong>: If you are given a ticket, accept it calmly and sign it when instructed to do so. Signing the ticket is not an admission of guilt. Refusing to sign the ticket can lead to your arrest.</ul>
</li>
<p>Remember that no matter what happens or what the police ask you, you should remain calm. Do not argue or swear. Your attitude can greatly affect the situation. </p>
<h3>Call a Lawyer Right Away</h3>
<p>If you are arrested or ticketed during a traffic stop, call the Chicago criminal defense attorneys at O’Meara Law right away. You have the right to an attorney at all times after you arrest. Simply say “I refuse to answer questions until I have an attorney present.” You cannot be punished for this and it is not an admission of guilty. </p>
<p>Call O’Meara Law at <strong><span class="ibp"> </span></strong> or use the online chat to schedule a consultation. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DUI checkpoints in Chicago are currently legal and active. Also known as roadblocks or mobile checkpoints, these designated stops allow police officers to protect the public from potentially inebriated drivers. Police can randomly stop and question vehicle occupants passing through a checkpoint, and conduct sobriety tests on suspicious drivers. According to the Center for Disease Control, DUI checkpoints can contribute to preventing ten percent of DUI-related fatalities. Common DUI checkpoints in Chicago include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grand Ave and Park Ave</li>
<li>Grand Crossing Area</li>
<li>Wentworth Area</li>
<li>Dan Ryan Expressway</li>
</ul>
<p>It is required in Illinois to publicize the checkpoints ahead of time.  You can learn more about when and where the chosen spots are at roadblock.org. </p>
<h3>What Happens If You Are Detained at a DUI Checkpoint?</h3>
<p>Being detained at a Chicago DUI checkpoint for the first time can feel scary and overwhelming. You may or may not have been drinking prior to taking the wheel of a car. Regardless of the situation, you are still entitled to certain rights, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right to Remain Silent:</strong> While you must show valid license and registration to the responding officer, you do not need to answer questions if you feel uncomfortable. </li>
<li><strong>Right Against Illegal Search and Seizure:</strong> The police do not have permission to search your vehicle without probable cause. </li>
<li><strong>Right to an Attorney:</strong> If you are arrested on a DUI-related charge, you should contact an experienced Chicago DUI defense lawyer immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>Officers typically look for signs of intoxication, such as slurred speech, bloodshot eyes, or hints of alcohol on your breath. You may be asked to subject to a standard field sobriety test. However, if you refuse this test, the officer may still be able to arrest you based on his observations. In addition, you may be asked to take a Breathalyzer test. Under the implied consent rule, refusing a Breathalyzer can lead to one year of license suspension for a first offense, or three years of license suspension for multi-offense. </p>
<p>Penalties for a drunk driving offense can be severe in Illinois. You may lose your license, have to pay hefty fines, or even end up in jail. When you are charged with a DUI offense in Chicago, having the right <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/dui/">Chicago DUI defense lawyer</a> by your side can make a huge difference. A skilled attorney can help negotiate with the prosecutor or judge, and potentially get your charges dropped. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few things are as stressful as getting charged with a crime. From the humiliation of getting arrested, to the inconvenience of court appearances, to the prospect of jail time and fines, facing the <a href="http://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.com/practice-areas/criminal-defense/">criminal justice system</a> can turn your life upside down. If you get convicted of a crime, you will get a permanent entry on your criminal record that can keep you from getting a job, owning a firearm, or going to school. </p>
<p>Fortunately, a skilled Chicago criminal defense attorney working at your side can help you avoid the harshest consequences of a criminal conviction. He or she may be able to obtain the dismissal of your charges, a victory at trial, or a deal with the prosecutor for a conviction of a lesser crime. And even if you do get a conviction, your crime may qualify for the expungement or sealing of your criminal record.</p>
<h3>Don’t Give Up Hope If You’ve Been Charged With a Crime</h3>
<p>Your lawyer may be able to have the charges against you dismissed, which means that you “win” your case even before it goes to trial. The prosecutor must have enough evidence in his or her case to make it worth the state’s time and money to put you on trial. If your lawyer can convince the judge that there isn’t enough evidence against you, your charges may get dismissed. </p>
<p>One strategy for obtaining the dismissal of your charges is filing a motion to suppress the prosecution’s evidence. If the motion to suppress is successful, the judge will order that some pieces of the prosecution’s evidence be removed from the case. When this happens, the prosecutor is often left without enough evidence to make a case against you. This leaves your lawyer in a position to request the dismissal of your charges.</p>
<h3>Your Lawyer Can Challenge the Prosecutor’s Evidence Against You</h3>
<p>Filing a motion to suppress the prosecution’s evidence may be an option in your case in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The police failed to respect your Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. For example, they searched your house without a warrant or pulled your car over without reasonable suspicion you were committing a crime.</li>
<li>The police denied your Fifth Amendment right to remain silent by failing to inform you that your words could and would be used against you.</li>
<li>You clearly requested that you wanted a lawyer but the police continued to interrogate you and obtained incriminating statements—which violates your Sixth Amendment Rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>If successful, the motion to suppress will result in the removal of any evidence obtained because of the authorities’ illegal conduct.</p>
<h3>You Can Beat the Prosecution’s Charges at Trial</h3>
<p>The prosecution must prove every element of its case beyond a reasonable doubt. This means that if you’ve been charged with drug possession, for example, the prosecution must present evidence that is so convincing that no reasonable person could doubt that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You had a controlled substance in your possession or under your control</li>
<li>You knew that the substance was illegal</li>
<li>The substance was actually illegal</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a difficult burden to meet. If your lawyer can show that there is some doubt as to even one of these elements, the jury will be instructed to enter a verdict of not guilty. For example, if your lawyer presents evidence that the equipment used to test the drugs was deficient, or that the crime lab has a history of not following procedures, there may be a reasonable doubt as to whether the substance in your possession was an illegal drug. </p>
<h3>A Good Lawyer Can Get You on the Jury’s Good Side</h3>
<p>Juries do not always follow the judge’s instructions. If the defense has proved there is a reasonable doubt as to an element of the prosecution’s case, the jury still has the ability to enter a verdict of guilty—in defiance of the judge’s instructions. In fact, some legal professionals believe that most juries utterly disregard their instructions and come to their conclusions based on their gut feeling—or prejudices. </p>
<p>Conversely, juries may be persuaded to enter a verdict of not-guilty even when the evidence overwhelmingly points towards your guilt. One of the most famous examples of a jury’s ability to derail the prosecution is the trial of OJ Simpson, who received a verdict of not guilty from a jury that deeply sympathized with him—despite the fact that he almost certainly was guilty. </p>
<p>A lawyer’s ability to portray you as a good person fighting an unfair criminal justice system can have a strong effect on the jury. Your attorney’s charisma and ability to tell a story is often just as important as his or her knowledge of the law. Attorney Michael S. O’Meara has both the experience and trial advocacy skills to get you excellent results when facing criminal charges. </p>
<h3>How a Chicago Criminal Defense Attorney Can Help You</h3>
<p>Although you don’t need a lawyer to obtain the sealing or expungement of your criminal records, your chances of success will be greater if you hire one to file the petition on your behalf. To learn more about expungement, record sealing, or how to defend against your criminal charges, call Chicago criminal defense lawyer Mike O’Meara today at <strong><span class="ibp"> </span></strong> for a free and confidential consultation of your case. </p>
